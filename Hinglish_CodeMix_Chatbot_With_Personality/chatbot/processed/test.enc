Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
No
Neat...
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Never
Thirty-two.
Get out!
That I'm used to.
That girl -- I --
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
You got him involved?
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Her favorite uncle
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Yeah
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
Hey.
Are you lost?
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
You hate me don't you?
You -- covered in my vomit.
hey.  Great show, huh?
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
I told you
Like you could find one
Who?
BIANCA
Wholesome.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Fallacy.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
Is that a request or a command?
My grandmother's .
Wait I...
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Is that right?
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
So what I want doesn't matter?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Right.
What?
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Tumescent!
Absolutely not.
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
He's the devil's child...
Your life, and that of others!
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
I haven't given you much of a life.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
Father...
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.
And were you never ambitious, Excellency?  Or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles, a fault for the rest of us?
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
You come!  You speak first!
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Thousands.
That's what it says.
Father Marchena!
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
How old are you, Senor Colon?
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
Don Moxica -- we all have to work.
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
He must be replaced.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.
Are you married?
So...the station is empty?
Yes, I considered it.
No.
What about back home?
So you were never a prostitute?
I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore.
Is he your boyfriend?
Do you have coffee?
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
A cop?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Vodka tonic.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Mind if I ride along with you?
I'm on duty.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
You wanna talk to her alone?
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
So...who's Nicky?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Yeah.
Okay.
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Don't speak Russian!
Whore?
I did.
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
You've got a call.
You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself.
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
Yeah?
Aren't you tired?
How was it?
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Yes, I thought so.
But not completely inconceivable?
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
Two more.
I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
CONTINUED
Thank you.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
But you don't have any idea as to what it is?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Pod Bay is decompressed. All doors are secure. You are free to open pod bay doors.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
What's the matter with my place?
You here to write my life story?
Bullshit.
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
There.
Let's go.
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
Maybe I don't like the way you ask.
They saved your ass, convict.
Just tell me about the money.
Right, partner.
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
You stay with me...
What if your girl's theory turns out to be bullshit?  I mean, they could be in Rio de Janeiro.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
You okay?
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
I lost them, that's what happened.
Is that what this guy Ganz had in the hotel?
You look awful.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
I don't think your gun's loaded...
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
What'd you do?
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
Hey, you know what I really think?
That's the way I see it, too.
Thanks for the coffee.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
Hey, two days with him is enough.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
How ya doin'?
Can't complain.
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Five bills.
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Who are you?
You noticed...
They all like this in your family, father?
It means, "Never without my permission".
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What kind of mission?
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
They really made her...
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Leeloo... is... she's...
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
How many points you got left on your license?
...Priest...
The Fifth Element...
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Don't you open your messages?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I thought you were divorced.
Three of us will never fit in there!
Cornelius..
Which one?
You get that off the screen?
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
Recommendations.
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Got it.
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
You couldn't?
I don't know what to say
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Bullshit.
What the fuck... !
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
And they are?
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
Is that him?
Don't let Longdale's questionable choice of weapon give you any ideas. If his fey little gun puts enough little holes in you, you'll be just as dead... and so will Max.
You're a dead man.
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
Any good?
What do you want?
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
Stop talking.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
You're making me very angry.
Give me the film.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Three, four years.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Child pornography.
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
A daughter.
Where does he sell it?
Well, I'm in New York now.  What do you say to flying out and giving me a hand?
Who is he?
What's this?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
Uh huh, pleasure.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
I told you I can't, not yet.
You've found missing persons before.
Nothing remotely like this.
Okay...
Hello... ?
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
I hope it's nothing serious.
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
Why do you think he did it?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
We're all like that.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
It's been six years.
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
No, you may not.
I'm required by state law to inform you that, while it's perfectly legal for you to purchase these items, it is illegal for you to use them for any sort of...
What?
Rick...I can't.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
Here you are.  Where were you this morning?  Rick's looking all over for you.
I'm sure they're around.
You what?
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
Not really.
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Here we are.
Nice neighborhood.
You just stay put.  You need rest.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
She doesn't want me around
Alice...
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
Unidentified Flying Objects.
But if they <u>do</u>?
'Us?'
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
I did go.  Just back.  Reef, these are a couple of our passengers - Sir Ian Hunt, and Dr. Clifford Kent.  My exec, Commander Richard Holloway.
Who with?
What do you think?
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
I plan to. Soon.
How soon?
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Yes.
You might be better off legally as well as financially to just go for the --
You see it?
Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
Mmm.
Yeah?
What happened?
Safety on?
Yeah.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Like you and Gordon?
Bastard's got his high beams on.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
Lawford?
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
No.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
What do you want, then?
Please don't cry. Please, honey.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
So?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Forget it.
Yeah. I mean that.
Everybody needs money. Except guys like Twombley and that sonofabitch son-in-law of his. People like that.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
Of course! I would've heard.
How?
When did she die?
It makes me sad.
Can --?
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Who are you?
Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
Where... how'd you hear that?
He got his deer yet?
Bang!
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
Huh?
The night before the shooting.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Anyone else want one? Rolfe?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
Wade, are you alright?
How was...  ...the ballet?
There they are!
You read my mind.
They aren't answering their hails.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
A dubious distinction, no?
*                     Please tell me your name.
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
That was war.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
May I speak to you for a moment?
How did your speech go?
Someone should give you a raise.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
But...
Yeah, right.
*                     We could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  The second amendment types'll love that.
What's the story?
Oveur.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Elaine.
Elaine, we have to go back.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
Ted!
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Can't we change course?
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
I don't want to hear that word!
What should I say?
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Can't you take a guess?
Well...not for another two hours.
No. No one that I know of.
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
But if you'll just give me...
Ted, what are you doing here?
Rats! I've lost number three.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
We have a visitor.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I'm Randy.
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
I like my horizons narrow.
He's not here.  Why ask me?
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
He didn't recognize me.
Kill them both.
My true name is Ss'tangya T'ssorentsa'.
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
What is this?
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
Mrs. Porter is not taking her husband's death well.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
This is mole.  It's good.
Yeah... I know the routine.
No shit, Holmes.  You're only from another goddamn planet, for chrissakes.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
Uh, George...
The fifty kilos, Matthew.  I have to find it.  I can't let it get out on the street.
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
But there's no more drug.
Mr. Hubley was an all right guy -- and a damn good manager.  The men liked him.  I'm really gonna have to scramble to fill his shoes.
The human?
Yeah.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
Yeah, Sykes?
Hope their plumbing's the same.
But you're bummed because your ex and her new husband are paying for the whole thing.
You got your vest?
Get outta there!
Set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  Immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
Yes.  That follows.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
Have they located my daughter yet?
Hear me out...
If I go.
That the atmosphere processor?
You son of a bitch.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
We got problems.
They'll get us.
What's this?
You're just reading me.
Sounds like you, Hicks.
Think of what?  We're fucked.
They cut the power.
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
What did you say?
Cross my heart.
This way.  Come on, we're almost there!
Are we going to sleep now?
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
Why won't you check out LV-426?
Maestro.
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
In a harem.
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
What?
Don't bother!
What?
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
You borrowed money from your mother?
Yes!
What's the matter with you?
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Oh, Stanzi.
I can't write it!
Frau Mozart?
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Then he didn't send you?
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
What do you mean?
I was at hand.
Leave him alone!
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
Money! Money!
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
Upstairs.
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
What a strange young man.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
Excuse me, but how old are you?
Mozart, I am a tolerant man. I do not censor things lightly. When I do, I have good reason. Figaro is a bad play. It stirs up hatred between the classes. In France it has caused nothing but bitterness. My own dear sister Antoinette writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people. I do not wish to see the same fears starting here.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Not that I've seen.
I don't know. He has pains.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
What did he say? What did he say?
What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
Madame.
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
You flatter me.
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
Confutatis Maledictis.
Start with the voices. Basses first. Second beat of the first measure - A.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, second beat.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  G-sharp, of course.
Yes.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Do you want to rest a bit?
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
Leave me alone.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
How well are you trained in music?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
Did you try?
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
I poisoned his life.
What difference does that make?
Ballet? What ballet?
Bravo, Your Majesty!
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
For the same reason, Herr Chamberlain, that it was banned in France.
Who is she?
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
What does he want?
Yes, Doctor?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
Did he say a wolf?
What did he say?
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Dr. Hirsch?
Shall I send a car?
What shall we do?
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
How is that?
What do you dream about?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
I'm twenty-seven.
I know.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
Will you think about it?
Now I'm embarrassed.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
The kitchen.
It's nice to see you.
The next corner we can get a cab.
David, what are you doing?
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
How are we feeling tonight?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
Yes.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Okay.
Nice looking group.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Ask them what the candles are for.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
I don't know. Come on.
What's the plan?
Where are we going?
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
Shut up, you zombie!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
A monster. I know, I know.
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
Whose death?
I remember once when your account checked.
Mr. Dickson in yet?
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Oh!
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I—
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Line?
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
Why, Matt!
Are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
I'm listening.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Yes, thank you.
Oh, make that uniform blue.
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is—
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
Why pick on him ?
Well, Sampson, what is it?
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.
Is it safe?
What did you do with it?
Yes.
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
He was here?
What did you find out, Mike?
Listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it—
Yes.
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
I guess so.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.
Uhh, yeah it does.
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
Corn gonna shoot at me?
They came up, made the same offer they made you folks. Our little brother Jim tried to chase 'em off, one of those detectives hit him in the head, knocked him out. Cole lost his temper.
You are a fine figure of a man.
Ride with me, cousin?
Hands off your hip, Cole.
What is wrong with you?
She was European!
Thanks for the help.
Because we were good at it?  Hell, we were great at it. Jesse, don't tell anyone I said this, because everybody knows I'm the toughest man in this town, but you are one terrifying sonofabitch with those guns.
So what do we do, General Lee?
It's not a bank.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Strategically.
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
Web died fighting?
What do you say, sir?
They're gone. What are you --
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
You're doing just fine.
You can shut up now.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
You're looking a bit more spry now that somebody --
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
Jesse, we're outlaws.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
Oh yeah.
Jim was old enough...
Yeah.
Yeah, Jimmy?
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
The Lord says we can bury 'em out back in the orchard, nobody'll ever find them.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
But still died.
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Little ones.
Hmm.
I beg your pardon?
Stop it. This is just sad.
You get arrested again, I'll kill you.
But I like the presidential suite.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
Good.
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
That.
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
Can't you tell me anything?
On a lot of lithium?
Pick me up?
Luis is a despicable twit.
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
You and...Luis?
Evelyn?
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
We never really shared one.
But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
No, he doesn't.
You saw the ad in the Times?
Don't come back.
It's just not.
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
Don't, I'll drink it.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
What is it?
Oh no. I have no plans.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Jean? Sorbet?
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?
Who's Ted Bundy?
Jean? What?
What are I doing?
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
You're at Paul Owen s.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
No. I'm okay.
Understandable.  Lime?
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Who do you ask?
No, I guess it's okay.
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
Don't you know this?
So was I.
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
I mean they want to get caught.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
But how? Where do you place Paul that night?
But Marcus denied it?
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
So who was he with?
I'm hungry.
Al.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
That took some fun out of --
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
I know, I know.
You think I don't know that?
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
...Why?
Don't we have any chopsticks?
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
Okay.
Would you like a Coke or something?
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
I do!
'Think I should buy some originals?
...Do I?
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
I heard what happened.
The wrong place?
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
Gary, I --
Okay, #2.
Let's go.
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
Keep looking.
You know mine.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
I snuck into #21.
You'd have to design a graphic interface to make the data pop. Maybe some audio, too. To tie it all in to Gary. How long would that take you?
Thank God.
Meet me at the other location.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
...He knows.
What does that mean?
That kid's the great white hope.
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
May I wash you?
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
When do I begin?
Yes?
Excuse me?
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
I've got you, Dr. Evil!
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
OK, OK, man, don't get heavy, I'll sign. Just to get things moving, baby.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
I don't get it.
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Really, Austin!
No, did you use a condom?
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
You know who.
Indeed.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
Shut up.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
I have something to tell you.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Oh my God, he's back.
Well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. Dr. Evil, I want you to meet your son.
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living?
I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
You didn't...
Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
Well, it's kind of weird.
What do you want to do, Scott?
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Black...
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
Ahem. As I was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
Whereas you are.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
I didn't. Mother did.
Do you?
I thought we were on our way.
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
Any other vices?
Mother and Dr. Darling have me under observation. They think I tried to kill you.
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Three agents killed by bad weather...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
Steed ... !
Mmm ... what are you doing?
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
I'll be back ...
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
Ah ... sun tan lotion. Any shops nearby?
I see.
Peter's brother?  But --
I was getting to it.
Global warming?
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
In your operation.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
Both, actually.
That's what we're going to find out...
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
All right!
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Yes, sir, I am.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
I hope Ilene's all right.
Great bathing suit.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
You're a pimp?
So, Larry, how have you been?
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
Yeah, I guess so.
Really?
What the hell are you doing?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Feel free.
The end.
Where the hell is he?
I'm not really hungry.
Right in there, pal.
He look familiar?
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
Is he...
What, you've never seen one before?
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
So you got a 'roid going with Jackson or what?
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Hey.
I could use a date.
Okay.
Got anything to drink in there?
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
You gotta tell a story too, Brian. It's fair. C'mon, don't think too hard --
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
I need another one, sir.
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
Uh, I'm Brian McCaffrey. Your new assistant.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
-- Shhh.
Son of a bitch tears 'em apart just to eat the oxygen. Wouldn't take much at all to melt ten gauge wire. Problem's burnt magnesium leaves a powder trace -- unless you could find something that would eat its residue.
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
But he killed these guys.
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
Then who wrote the report?
Did I say thanks?
Yeah.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Where's Sean?
He's out.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
Tell him about me, Shadow?
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
"Don?"
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
I'm a little busy right now --
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
People.
So what are you doing here?
I forgive you.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
I forgive you.
Oh God, my God. it's goddamn good to be good. Forgive me. Father, for I have sinned. It's still goddamn good to be good.
It's still my money. If you want to have a chance at any part of it, shithead, you will take my $120,000 and bet on tomorrow's game.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Let me think about it.
Oh, really?
Here's the deal: You meet me tonight across from the Garden. 33rd & 8th. At the beginning of the Ninth Inning. We'll listen to the end of the game together. You bring your cash, I'll bring mine.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
Get this, man. I was at the game today. Face to fucking face with Strawberry! Jesus! I saw him strikeout. And you know what? He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he laughed and I laughed and it was like we were all alone in that whole stadium and only we understood that it was all a racket, that he struck out on purpose, and that he's saving it up for the Big One. Tomorrow. Today I understood for the very first time that --
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
Everybody say Ho!
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Well you did.
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
What's your name?
Seconds and thirds, too.
You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
You can walk away.  We both can.
How much?
We was coming to see you.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
Manray, I'm very sorry about ya boy Cheeba and Sloan.  Believe me, it gave me no joy pulling ya coattail about her, just lookin' out for a brother.  I feel you, all this stuff happenin' at once but you can't let if affect your work.  You gotta be professional.
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
I'm sorry I'm late.
The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
Go on.  Good so far.
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
I want to speak with you.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Dunwitty wants a Coon show.  And that's what I'm going to give him, it's going to be so racist, so negative, he won't have the balls to put it on the air.  Hence I'll prove my point.
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
The Jolly Nigger Bank.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Please don't go there.
Don't make me have to use this.
Yes, your name?
Hi, Mona.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Not nervous?  Relaxed?
No joke.  Serious.
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
No.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
I thought you got rid of...
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
A lot?
What do you want to know?
This is a nice place.  It must have cost a pretty penny.
Y'know what?
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
Not one.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
Will we always leave it at this?
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
As much as possible.
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
I beg your pardon?
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Bill Styles...
I don't want to go --
West was one thing, but this --
What about you, wandering around alone? At least we have an alibi --
You too?
There's no need...
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
You shot Childs and Nunez.
You saved Kendall's life --
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
Look in my pack.
Why?
I... I don't know...
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Something funny, Levi?
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
Home, I'm done.
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
You're drunk --
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
Is Dunbar cute?
Thank you. At some point in there I'm gonna rub my nose. When I do, go at him with everything you got.
What is that?
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
Why do you care?
What?
And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
So what now?
No bodies, no West...
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
There are degrees of truth, officer. Always degrees.
Do I have a choice in this?
What are you doing out here?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
We should tell him we're not going.
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
Because he'd shot Mueller.
It won't work --
Who, Levi --
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
Bullshit --
Yeah.
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
You want Kendall, don't you?
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
Yes.
You were expecting me?
Don.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
There was one time when I was eleven...
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
You don't like it?
You can see my predicament. My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
No, she was old and probably senile. Maybe schizophrenic.
So how does it happen?
You think I'm fake.
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.
It's unbelievable.
I was drying out.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
Really.
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
I talked with your father last night.
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
That really happened?
What do you mean?
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
I'm asking what you're here for.
Oh.  We are Russian.
Hold on.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
He wants money.
Yes.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
Syevodnya?
In every sense. If at all possible.
What?
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
We'll pretend it never happened.
And who says what is wrong.
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
Why?
You...
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
What? I... I wasn't saying...
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
No.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
No. I think I better just go.
It's not mine.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
What do you need?
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
For your hands?
Holy shit.
She's around. Always is.
Now wait...
You wanna go home?
You sayin' you'll do what?
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
Teh... Tehronne?
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
Let me say somethin' first...
Why you got me chained?
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
You some kind'a pervert?
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
I know that.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
He tapped that.
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
Laz, I know about that girl.  Good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  Oh, Laz. She's had a mess of crabs and them STD's. What'chu thinking?
You mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
You won't at the square this mornin'.
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
That's right.
Got in a little accident.
You need money again?
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
You got any money?
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
Hey, hey, where you goin'?
Get rid of it.
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
Some party.
What are you doing?
What'd you say?
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.
Sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
You cool, Ich?
Where're you going, Ichiro?
Give us a break...
What's he saying?
You're doing fine, Ich.  Now drop it, okay?
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
Gaiijin.
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
Where does this Sugai live?
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
Big enough.
It's illegal, Nick.
Let's go.  Him first.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
Thank you.  You have one?
What's that for?
Louder, pal, louder.
We can't lose.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
Where's the wife?
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
They want your autograph.
No one's keeping him here.
You and Charlie are taking the Jap home, tonight.
You lost a man we wanted for some time.  It was very incompetent on your part, officer.
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
He knows what he's doing.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Death.
Why are you staring at us?
You could help us.
Where are you going, Sebastian?
What's going on down there?
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
Yeah.
How do I stop one?
Do you have something against science?
Nexus designated Mary:  incept November 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
How old am I?
Sorry.
Nerves of steel.
During the road test...
But you haven't put in for emigration.
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
They probably want to find out when they were made.
Me and my dad.
You mean a woman?
What difference will it make?
Let's keep our eyes on the road, Deckard.
What's that?
Is that why you're still here?
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
What makes you think so?
Your mom was a dancer?
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
It was amazing.
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
What is it?!
Over this?
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
Hey, what are you doing?!
Take it. damn it!
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Doing what?
Very funny, smart ass.
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Okay.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
When do you need her by?
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
Could we talk about that a little later?
Yes!
Yes!
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
I certainly do!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
I thought I was here to meet women.
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
But, Eve, I would--
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
...I do.
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Yes, sir. It's true.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
The recovery is very impressive.
Does that work?
Thirty-five.
Sure.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
I'll be all right.
Oh, my God!
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
He drank it hot?
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
How long will we have to stay down here?
Yes, dear!
Home sweet home!
The locks.
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
I'm not hungry.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Yes, yes it is!
Mutants?!
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
We stay down here.
You came back for these?
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
You're serious, aren't you?
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, that's blunt!
Alright, I will.
We did not leave together.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
Yes, you do.
Uh, yes, you do.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Have him committed.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
What?!
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Okay.
Why do you do it?
No, not at all.
You're all through with this now?
For now. Alright, you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Yes? What is it?
I wanted to see you.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
I, I don't know.
Do you like that?
I, uh.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
It used to make me laugh, but.
You like to open me, don't you?
Does that scare you?
I asked first.
I love you Don with all my heart.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
Hold me, Don.
Frank gone?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Can I feel 'em?
Go where?
Heineken.
Hey? You like to walk.
Yes.
There ya go.
That sounds great!
No.
Well.
Hi Dad.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Are you feeling okay?
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
I guess you have to get back home soon?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
What happened to him?
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Oh, okay, can I call?
Well, how did it go? What happened?
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
That's what I thought.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
I don't know. I had a dream. In fact, the night I met you.  In the dream the world was dark because there weren't any robins. You know, birds. Robins stood for love, and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. And it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. I guess, until the robins come there is trouble.
You want to go talk to him?
What is it?
You look beautiful.
I should go with her, Sandy.
No Jeffrey!!
Look Jeffrey.
Just for him?
Yes mother.
Anybody you think is evil?
Yes.
Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
What are you saying?
You guys gotta teach me that prayer, man. That's some good shit.
Be careful.
He got beat up by a girl.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
I don't know they just always need it.
On TV ya always get that asshole that jumps behind the couch.
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
And number three, Dolly.
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
So what are you thinkin' here?
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
What?
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Chief, what the fuck is this?
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Liberating isn't it?
What do you want me to say?
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
He says. This is he.
Did you see what I meant about the window?
It's got a V-8, Dignan.
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
That sets it off.
Yeah, I heard that.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Well, then cut it in half.
Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do that.
She's from Cuba.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
He's gone. He stole the car.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
You don't know how to hotwire.
That's what she is!
I know that. But --
Applejack would of got him anyway. This was just the quicker way.
God. Isn't this great? Working on the job. Got a wheel man. Got a safecracker. Good friends with Mr. Henry.
As a person?
Take your second position.
What?
I'm not kidding.
You're living on a sailboat?
So how is it in there? 
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
How does that feel?
Did Dignan take the test?
The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Are you serious?
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.
Bob, where you going?
Sixty days?
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Were you adopted, Bob?
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
Yeah.
Wait. Did he see us?
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
That never would of --
How much could you grow? Realistically.
The guy is fucking insane.
I warned you, Dignan.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
He electrocuted someone?
I told you they were there.
It's registered in my mother's name.
What the fuck possessed you?
But it's not his. How can they arrest Future Man?
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Bullshit.
Applejack drove.
What's that?
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
I might have mentioned it.
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Oh, yeah.
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?
Yes.
Why?
Why did he go that way? 
No. Just pool.
What do you mean?
That's not gonna fly.
I want to know what happened.
Do you know what his budget was?
Jesus...
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
No. It's because you don't know how they died.
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
I have to go now.
I emptied it.
You still should've moved.
So why didn't you kill me then?
What's going on in Berlin?
-- it hasn't been two years --
I worry when you get like this.
I should be better by now.
He was at the campground yesterday.
You do?
Yes.
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
What do you mean?
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
I want someone I know to take me in.
Who's going? Us?
-- go -- take the van! --
We'll know for sure when we get the security tapes.
Who's this?
How long have you worked for the agency?
Good luck.
Believed what?
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
And why is that?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
By who?
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
A wise plan. And how is your father? We have missed him at the council.
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
So I did! And what was so important about it?
Wallace's followers.
I'll wait... back there.
Test of manhood.
You win.
Good to see you again.
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
You've been here before?
I am the Princess of Wales.
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
Peace is made is such ways.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
I... I blacked out.
Please, mom. People will talk.
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
There must be a way to fix this.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
Welcome home. Thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
Are you okay?
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
I don't get it.
And...?
That should buy you ten minutes at least.
What?
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
Nothing. Just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
Yes, I'll bet.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
And I was wondering.
Strange. I know so very little about you.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
Please.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
You can believe that if you want to.
When did you first find out he was alive?
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Be careful.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
Are you ready Ilsa?
What of it?
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
Well, this might come in handy.
But we made a deal.
Everything in order?
I understand.
I believe you have a message for him?
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
Is that a serious offer?
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
He is traveling with a lady.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
Huh?
I have. Sit down over there.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Make it official, if you like.
Put that phone down!
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
Uh, my watch stopped.
Where is she? Have you seen her?
It took this test package thirty-two hours to get from Seattle to St. Petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  And then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in St. Petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
Do too little you'll die.
Take it, damn it.
You're putting off the inevitable.
Fix raft first.
Why do they have to die for me?
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
As much as anybody.
I had it on the island with me.
Sonofabitch!
Merry Christmas eve.
You don't seem too happy about it.
You can't go now.
If I'd known you were alive --
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
When's the next Jumbo?
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
What happened to your pants?
Okay.  After three years the PTR reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the CPC.  Here it is.  Ten packages from the same sender.  Baku. Delhi.  St. Petersburg.  The guy was a real road warrior.  This package was Kuala Lampur.  No activity in his account after this package.  No forwarding addresses after K.L.
What's going on down there?
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
And never take.
That's why you're a gambling man.
To life.
Thanks.  For everything.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find *them*.
Why not?
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
It's time somebody ate *them*.
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
Is your family in the apple business, too?
Oh...
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
I'm okay--I can walk.
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
I thought they might take me.
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
You mean somebody asked?
That's a heavy sedation.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
I don't remember.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
Liberator...
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
They're migrants.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
First pregnancy?
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
You're not yet three months, are you?
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
But you don't look very happy.
Now, now. He's a good boy.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' where you and Homer and Rose Rose is at.
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
Where do you think you're going?
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
Exactly. But the Catch-22 is that you can't tell anyone about the offer, because if it's public, you could start a bidding war and that's considered a breach of etiquette. It could kill a deal. But, wait too long and you're not considered hot anymore.
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
And I think it's because of this redhead...
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
She had you tempting fate.
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?
Masters of our own destiny.
Seems Lionel Dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night. They just pulled him out of the East River.
Well, this is just fucking great...
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
Calls?
Why not?
I think two million.
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
What is this? You guys cops or something?
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
We have work. It pays a lot. Unless you figure on getting rich lifting wallets while old guys feel you up.
Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
Glenn talked you out of it.
Sorry. I didn't know...
You tell them the "Tale".
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
You're sure? This is... Just a complete disaster.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
I'm sorry.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
Sorry. What?
Then who's the Banker?
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
Special Agent?
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
Did he buy it?
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
No. Thanks.
I can imagine.
Eight-fifty.
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
Not entirely.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
You're my prisoner.
In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
Are you drunk?
Do you have to swear all the time?
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
Really?
Then what?
Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...
There's a casino in this hotel.
The debts.
I don't have any money.  switches on the light. JANI is looking distressed.
You're serious.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
How much do you owe?
And your hand too.
Ross.
You've done pretty well.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
And the girls?
I'm off. I need to sleep.
Why four? And not three or five?
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
Girlfriend?
Yes.
This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
He's paying out in stacks of 25.
How do you feel, Jack?
Key? Key? What is the key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
The key!
Oh, God...
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
That's it.
What are you gonna name it?
Commander Powell would have named it.
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Yeah?
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Sorry.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
Who's Camille?
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
You mean until you showed up?
Out there.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
You didn't...
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
Lauren's not my wife.
The other ones?
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
A girl.
You believe that?
With your help.
I need to talk to her.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
You're also a fool.
Say the words, "I understand."
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
That's odd...
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
So are dogs.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
And she bought that?
Can you put that in a bag or something?
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
Here's the dealio on Eyes Only.  He's probably some wack rich dude sitting around in a trick-ass apartment, bored stupid.  So he gets off on scarin' the poop outta folks like you-- I gotta go.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
What's it worth to you?
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
What was that D.J.'s name again?
One more time in English.
Sunday, but...
There's only so much trouble an individual can get into till it just doesn't matter anymore, Lex. You familiar with a condition known as Absolute Zero?
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
Hawk?
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Look, you can have my wallet...
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
You are contradicting yourself, Donnie. If we could see our destines manifest themselves visually... then we would be given the choice to betray our chosen destinies. The very fact that this choice exists... would mean that all pre-formed destiny would end.
We went to a hotel.
Hey...
Wanna walk me home?
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
It's a good thing the school was flooded today.
Why is that?
Why?
What happened to your neck?
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
People aren't that simple.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
Where are you going?
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
Cellar door.
His name is Frank.
How so?
He said to follow him.
Yes.
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
I know.
Yes.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
When will this happen?
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
I... What can we do?
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
She's alive, sweetie.
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
Thank God for bunge cords.
Okay.
"Here," wh-wh-what?
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to me? Why're you pretendin' you don't know what's goin' on?
Oh -- oh, you bring me some of that snotty attitude, Becky -- bring it on.
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
Are we on "Cops" again?
Y'know, if you have, you got all the pictures of the winner you need.
That bitch from...
And the year before that?
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Nothin' too showy!
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
This is -- what?
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
Hey you!!
I don't call him, I whistle.
'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
Fine.  We gotta him. 
How'm I doing, boss?
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
Once more! 
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
Oh, won't you reconsider...
Now -- er --
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
Yes please, two.
You won't be long?
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
He fell.  He falls.
He's a clumsy git. Never watches where he is going.
This man belongs in hospital.
I want my man back.
Now I think we really do understand one another.
It's quite nutritious, sir.
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
Why isn't he in the General Ward, then?
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
You never mentioned his mental state.
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
Alas, no.
Tell me about it, please!
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
You alright?
Yes.
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
Yes.
Yyess.
Mmmerrick.
Righteousness...
Good evening. How are you feeling?
How long will I stay here?
You look splendid, John.
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
You want a dressing bag, John?
Yes John?
Won't come out, eh?
Now Mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for John. He relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
A dressing bag?
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
And who might you be, sir?
Pardon me?
It's all in your own mind, Father... It's YOU who imagine that I'm always up here with some man or other....
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
WELCOME?
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
What's the matter?
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
You've been to bed with somebody else, haven't you?
Who?
Halfdan the Black.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
I... but I...
Yes -- I believe you do.
Then I shall come too.
It is day, of course, Freya.
Would you like us to sing to you?
I'm sure it's lovely.
No. 
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
He wants to kill US!
Yes.
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
You don't love ME.
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
About NOT raping you...
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
What?
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Slower! Nobody can row at that speed!
Ohh! I wanted to sit next to Leif.
It's magic.
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Row!
A magic dishcloth.
No! Let go, Snorri!
Who gets killed?
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
I AM one, Dad!
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
That's why they call me... Leif the Lucky.
I know. I know.
And a sort of slightly sick feeling?
For your own sake... For the others... I...
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Wasn't it, Keitel?
You've lost your mind.
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
So did my father and his father before him.
Not now, Sven...
Shut up.
Thorfinn! You can't die!
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
You rat.
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
So you like bookstores, huh?
Take care.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
How can you watch this crap?
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
You remember what happened next?
There's this guy!
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
I know.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
What are you doing?
I think we should go.
Tomorrow?
Listen, did you want to make love?
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
Naomi.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
What? What do you mean?
Yours?
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
Oh! Great. That's great!
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
I had a good time last night. I really did.
We'll speak soon.
You found us okay?
That's a good one.
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
Howard, your one o'clock.
Okay, we're back in.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
I have a family, Mary.
I tried that already.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
What's your bartlett's?
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
Tell me about it.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
What is Debbie's position?
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Extraordinary!
I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
How does she like what in bed?
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
For magazines?
A born freak can only go uphill.
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
What?
You weren't there. I saw it.
What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
Is that an offer?
What's happening?
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
How is he?
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
Hear what?
What happened?
What's happening...?
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
You're not seriously considering sending him?
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
Patch me through to him.
The crew? Could they still be alive?
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
It's insane.
If it worked.
You have something, Dr. Weir?
Explanation?
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
Where has it been for the past seven years?
I DON'T KNOW!  I don't know. There's a lot of things going on here that I don't understand. Truth takes time.
You... You can't do that!
Weir is dead.
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
But...
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
Thank you.
What is it, Smith?
Smith, get out of there...
Come again, Skipper?
I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
What about the life readings you picked up?
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
Go ahead.
What's going on in there, Starck?
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
Claire...
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
He's engaged the override.
If they are, they're screening their calls.
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
What happened to his eyes?
Explosive decompression.
A straight line.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
You don't know what it's like out there. Walking around like some kind of circus freak. People staring, whispering --
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
He didn't.
Where is Reed?
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
I can't take this.
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
I had it at four.
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
I don't know. I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Ben. Are you okay?
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What?
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
You're on fire!
This is wrong in so many ways.
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Then what is it?
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Feeling better?
You're happy for me and Victor.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
Come on, Ben, come on...
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
Ben did this.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
Reed's gonna fix me up --
First door on your left!
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
Is everything okay at work?
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
Well...
I think we're making a lot of noise.
What's wrong?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
Really?
Did you go home and get it?
Damone, are you there?
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
How often do you go?
Are you going to ride that wave?
He is.
My brother's car!
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
So what did you do?
Really?
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
Does that ever happen?
How long does Doug take?
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
What do you think it is?
He's not coming.
Sometime?
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
What's that?
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
That's a nice shirt.
We keep them.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
So... pretty nice house you've got here.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
John Bonham?
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
Are you ready to order here?
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
Shoot it.
That's good...
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
Did the mescaline just kick in? Or was that Debbie Reynolds in a silver Afro wig?!
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
What tape?
Read the newspapers.
Hell, in Malibu alone, these goddamn Satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. All they want is the blood. They'll take people right off the street if they have to.
No, she's looking for you.
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
...grow claws... bleeding warts.
Could I have that, please?
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
Stop!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
Where are you two going?
IS IT CLEAR?!
I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
So, your husband ditched you?
Scared?
Just an observation.
You weren't helpin'.
Well then I guess we should just give up.
Why do you take shit from him?
Oh, no.
Will these boards hold?
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
Holds four.
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Clever fuckers.
HELP MEEE!
Hey!
Let's wait it out.
And the last one is the...
If there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
Well...
Well... come on.
You're right. I'm sorry.  Okay, let's go get 'em.
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
Where's Clifford?
An actress.
You learn your lines?
There've been some calls.
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
...I see.
Were you a drug addict?
Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
Francie, you know I can't do that.
Please, Francie...
See you next weekend?
You sound as if you hate it.
Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
You think I'd miss it?
Well? What'd you think?
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
Frances...
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Kaminski.
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
That's right.
You know something, Harry?
What a man!
To quarter-horses.
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
Who?
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
Where you goin'?
Shit!
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Did you expect him to look you up?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
Fine!
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
You kill me, Mama.
I think I need a little air.
Say you promise.
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
...Did you really say that?
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
Frances, I'm warning you...
This was not taken from a grave.
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
I've loved you all my life
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
I've no choice
It is
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Can you think of a better reason?
Quite a few.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
Only you would think of that!
I've been preoccupied.
Yes? And?
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
You've been going round-the-clock?
Are you sure you'll be all right?
You know of it?
What'd you see?
Melvin Belli.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
Any particular reason?
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
Good point.
Help you clean up?
Where?
Marcie?
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
Why don't we run? Just run now?
Sure.
Claudette...
You just had some lucky shots.
I don't believe you...
That was the telephone.
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
I don't love Neddy.
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
One night on the town.
That's thirty percent.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
Bad enough we got a full moon; it's Friday the 13th. They keep statistics. We get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there's a full moon. It affects people. Makes 'em nuts.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
So do I just follow you?
Why did they block the door again?
Where is the little lady?
Is this real?
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
That happens, you'll get it back.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
How many bullets left, kid?
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
Hot goddamn day!
What dya mean?
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
When I count three, shoot out the bottles behind him!
No.
What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin' woman, the hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
You just called me a fuckin' nut.
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
My shit is together.
Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
-- nothing I can do about it unless you're suggesting I infringe on their civil liberties -- which I'd happily do if you'll just trim a little fat off the Constitution.
Standing right here in my office.
Thank you, sir.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
Think I overplayed it?
Did you hear?
I was one member of the investigating commission.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
What changed?
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
The Navy Cross...
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Which is guy-speak for...
Well, not this.  I was doing the Pentagon scene few nights ago.  Got some fresh stuff -- about you.  You may be in a hostile camp.  I think someone may be taking steps to ensure that you crash and burn.
C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me.
They're more afraid of you.
Well, now I feel so much better.
I think you look beautiful.
Do you, uh, know...
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
Should I be afraid?
Wasn't deemed a threat.
Good to see you again, too, sir.
O'Neil...
Darth Vader reads poetry...
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
Me!? You where the one...
That why you dumped him?
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
Nesting?
Who is he?
Wish me luck!
So have dinner with me tonight.
I can't.
What?
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
And how should we do that, Sir?
Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
We've met before.
Why do you need that?
Contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
Just don't.
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
Nothing.
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
And note the sucked in gut.
You have a better plan, Alex?
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
WE'VE HAVE TO STOP!
Hi Brandon.
Commander, as I was saying... In "The Quasar Dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for Gamma override. But online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
Okay, we got it.
Commander, do you have a camera?  I'd die to see this in person... All they showed on T,V was a machine here, and a wall here... I don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
Go. They're off again.
Structural damage at 68 percent.
There is no weather in space.
The enemy is matching velocity.
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
The Omega 13... Why does that sound so familiar?...
Yeah, what is it?
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
JASON...
Do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Jason?...  I don't think the pig lizard was Gorignak...
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
You should have let me hit him.
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
We pretend...
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
You... You mean Earth?
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Weapons storage...
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Let's do it, Tommy.
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
That can't be.
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
I'm so inclined.
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
You won't be needing his largess, Rhode Island is already committed to your appointment.
Oh, come now...
The man is a traitor!
What is it, Marquis?
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
But, you do come from a military family?
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
George, I'm sorry.
All people have rights!
I say!
William, we've been studying hard, I really know my stuff.
And I mean high up in it.  That's why Harry's gonna make Mr. Lovejoy with me, not Chili Palmer.
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
You get the money?
And that's for the airport.
Where is my nephew?
Your who?
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
That's a nice scream, lady. You oughta be in movies.
Only this time, no John Wayne and Dean Martin shooting the bad guys in El Dorado.
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people –-
Chili Palmer showed you my script?
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
You get to town, you go straight to the bank, raid the limo account.
Ray Barboni?
Who is this?
Hello? You there?
Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
You live in Miami?
I'm a producer.
Your wife a Lakers fan?
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
You mean, Leo?
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
Martin Weir. He played the mob guy that turned snitch in "The Cyclone".
She looks familiar.
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
You don't even know these guys.
Hey, Harry.
Personally?
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
Twenty seven hundred.
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
Who told you that?
How'd you know I was here?
You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
...That's what we finally decided.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
I got you a copy of the script.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
Not yet.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?
How'd you meet Martin anyway?
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
He's doing the same thing you did to him, playing Letterman on TV.
What took you so long?
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
So Mildred says to the cashier, 'I saw the new Streisand picture.'  'God, I just love it at the end when she brushed Robert Redford's hair off his forehead the way she did when they were together, and the way they gave each other this look that said they still loved each other, but knew they couldn't be together. That look was so... romantic.'
Be quiet and listen.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
Which two?
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
I have to consider, I mean, as the mob guy, this is another man's wife I'm sleeping with.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Sixty pounds.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Yeah, but not as cold as those Swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
What?
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
Did you?
Went aboard.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
What's slow?
That's a good thing?
What?
Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
So what did happen?
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
How's he doing?
What do you think happened on this boat?
The what?
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
Epps? You there?
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
I think I see it pretty well.
I must be in the wrong business.
Some classy tub in it's day, huh?
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
Can't find the shotgun.
I thought you say Tuesday.
No, no. You got leak.
Someone from the past.
Pumpkin? What's wrong?
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
But I was only trying to be friendly...
What the hell is wrong with you?!
Well lose it! And why aren't you pushing the large sizes? Didn't you get training about upsizing?
Aren't there a million places like this?
Hi... what's up?
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
Oh, hi...
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Okay... I promise.
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
Hey - why do you have this?
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
You know, the green cardigan guy.
Why do I always have to do it?
Are you sure?
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one  ...Oh wait...  you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
Just promise you'll do it.
I totally, totally hate you.
Where did you get that?
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday...  Shit! What time is it?  I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
When was this?
I said "great"...
Hi.
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Well, we won't keep you.
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Go die, asshole!
You're late, asshole.
I did too!
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
Good luck...
What about her? Would you go out with her?
I - I'd really rather not...
PLEASE? We have to!
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
You work at Cook's Chicken?
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
Hey, can I borrow this?
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
Uh... hello?
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
I... I wish I could, Enid, but I really can't right now... I -- it's just that I --
No, of course not.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
What?
I agree.
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
On that pathetic fake blind date.
So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Yes?
You were contracted to work-
Morning, friend, glorious day.
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
I do need to see Starling.
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
And it worked?
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
Understand, I had help-
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
Don't much like them.
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
What?
All right- thee second embankment will go there. 
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
I'll try- but this feels so different- that old lion I killed could never carry off a man Singh's size.
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
Have you got it?
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
Why?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
Good news?
Do you love her?
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
Did you ever see a lion that size?
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
My life was shaped because someone invented gunpowder. Our lives have crossed because two lions went mad. But what if in the future the three of us do something grand for humanity? Was that worth all the lives? Too soon to tell.
We don't have a relationship.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
Okay, that's no problem.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
Good-bye, Peter.
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
That's a terrible thing to say.
That's quite a story.
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
No, I celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is March first. That way I beat the crowds.
It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?
Command me, lord.
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
Get on with it, counselor!
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
So far so good.
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
It won't work.  There's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
What's your story, Pete?
Ummm -- figure eight?
No.  They're just coming to me.
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
Oh, Dana, it's you.
Who's the stiff?
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
All right.  Since you put it that way.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
What's that got to do with it?
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
In a storage facility.
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
All right.  What is it?
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
All right.  I'll try.
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
You mean if I stand here and concentrate on the image of Roberto Clemente, Gozer will appear as Roberto Clemente and wipe us out?
I told you it's real.
I don't know.  Talk to it.
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
So do I.
Ray -- Something's here.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
Tribuus... tomorrow.
What are you talking about?
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
That's difficult to say, general.
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
Take grain away from the army?
This is the only place in Rome where I thought -- I believed -- I was wholly in power.
It's because he comes off as the underdog.
Yes, Caesar?
Tribuus!  Go left here, I want to see my new statue at Via Claudia.
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
I'll nose around...
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
The battle was won, today, and I prefer to believe it was a gift of Janus, the eldest God of Rome.  God of my ancestors.
I've read of it.
You're hearing about somebody else.
Why you?
Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
Twenty years I've led men to die. For me it was the glory of Rome. But that was something.  If it wasn't that, then it was the pay or the loot of the next whore -- but that was something!  These men here are butchered for laughs!  Their lives are like jokes delivered in the back alley theaters where their death is a punch line!
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
Greeks?
They're studying with Cynics.
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
I killed too many barbarians.
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Before they leave, get gold.
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
No.
Will you take me home now?
That woman. The older woman.
Come in.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Elaine -- I love you.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
The day after tomorrow?
Is the doctor anywhere?
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
You a student?
You're not one of those agitators?
Oh -- no sir.
Mr. McCleery?
BENJAMIN?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
Mrs. Robinson?
Can I help you, sir!
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Where is it?
Where is your luggage?
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
Will you take me home?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
Why not?
Look -- I think I should be going --
Well I don't know.
No.
Benjamin?
Thank you.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
What?
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
I got a single room.
That's fine.
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Why don't you watch?
Wood or wire? They have both.
On your first time --
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Yes I do.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
The driveway's on my side of the house.
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
Well how long has this been going on.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
Is it?
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
Well I can't.
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
Why not?
I was just kidding around.
Don't start acting hurt.
Did I say that?
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
If that's how you feel --
Go home now.
Where is Elaine?
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
I'll find her.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
No -- actually I'm not --
I'll find your table in a moment. Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.
When I go off?
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Oh, no.
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
No.
That has nothing to do with it --
What?
I've got to go.
Sir?
You'll never be young again.
Thank you.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
I will.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
No, I don't.
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Yes?
I'd like to discuss this.
They came all the way from Tarzana.
Turn 'em up.
Have you a minute now?
Time's getting short.
No --
I don't like your tone.
You might find a bullet through that head...
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Aren't you?
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
We'll dance.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
For tonight. 
Oh!
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
Do you understand?
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
For Vienna?
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
No?
I'm worried about you.
Till then.
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
The Baron is tired?
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
I don't know.
Any letters?
Anyone asked for me?
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
The Grand Hotel.
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.  Oh, the pain.
Stay where you are.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
Yes.
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Am I!
What is this?
You...
Moreover...
What?
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
Hello!
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
Tomorrow morning.
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance. 
Well -- you want me?
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
I mean with the Manchester people?
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
Take them back, Suzette.
I wish to be alone.
What -- what is it? Last night...
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Have I kept you waiting?
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Next week.
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
You mean, the insurance frammis?
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
You're a thousand percent right!
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
Can't move.
Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
What? He's going to be all right!
All right.
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
It's not your fault.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
What are you talking about? So I've got a job. So what?
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
Up to you.
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
Myra followed you, huh?
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
I thought it over, and you were right. You wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
I know you do, so that's why --
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
I don't?
This time...
Big spender.
I'll sign that affidavit.
What?
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Where?
Take a hike, you mean?
I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
I saw her.
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
Don't I get any say in this?
I'm happy the way I am.
) What?
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Yes, I know, I know.
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Oh, Jesus.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Detective...
I never stop thinking about it, Detective.  The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
You some kind of fugitive or something?
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
Just get on the bus.
Not me.
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
Looks great.  It does.
It's always John.
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange...
What?
Who?
So you're really Michael Meyers' sister?
Can't you hold it?
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
But I've seen him!
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
Where's the baby?!
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
Come on!
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
There you are.  Who was that boy?
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
It was you.
Jamie's baby ...
What do you know about Michael?
Didn't recognize you.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
Um.
Looseleaf--will you get the hell home?
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
Go home!
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
And how were things?
First Nagasaki--now this.
The educational process.
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
Go to the funeral?
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
Everybody thinks that.
The posies are for her?
What an awful sound!
If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.
You're hollow, like a woman.
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
Ask it!
Mind?  God, yes, I mind.  I'm your father's friend.  A man claiming to be the family physician let me in a while ago.
He's a vacuum cleaner salesman.
College!
They were in the same creative writing class.
He insults him all the time.
I don't know.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Damn.
Of course it is.  Is it loaded?
No.
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
Not at all.
Like hugging a lamp post.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
What a honeymoon.
People don't use that word any more.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
Yes.
I came for Paul as well.
Just one favor.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
Blue soup?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
He's a child!
If he thinks he's man enough.
I mean it!
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
She's right, Norbert--go home. WOODLY I haven't said all I have to say.
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?
We'll miss you so.
She's fine.  Please--
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
Good Lord.
It died for your sins.
This is man to man.
What brought you back?
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
Don Quixote.
My violin is avenged!
The new hero is you.
You're too modest.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
No!
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
No.  No.
Can't do it.
Thank you--for my life.
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
I'll kill myself.
I know.
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
How did she lose her feet?
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
Everything stays as it is!
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
He is my father.
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
Yeah.
Is he all right?
Is he coming home?
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
We've got to rescue him.
Do it!
It's good.  Let him go.
No. I don't think so.
Do you want to take a session?
No, I don't.
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
Yeah.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
Are you Niki?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
Yeah.  I'm her father.
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
Say what?
'Sucking off.'
No.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
What the crap?
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to Heaven.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
Where are you? The connection sounds very good.
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
What have you found out?
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.
What are you doing here?
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
How's your business, Jake?
Jake?
What?
What is going on?
Yeah.
No.
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
But I...
You don't want anything for your fifty cents?
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
Huh?
You can fuck off, too.
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
No.
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
How long have you been driving?
Your tree.
Okay, lady. Out.
Haven't we met before?
Is this your shovel?
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Check.
Because if you are...
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
Nice to meet you.
No, thank you. I have my car.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Harold?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Over there by the courthouse.
But we can't just dig it up!
The ice is melting.
Did Confucius say that?
It's so blue.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
With God?
Oh.
But they'll put me in jail.
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
That wasn't very scary.
You sure have a way with people.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
Supper for two.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
Farewell?
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Of course, Harold's father had a similar sense of the absurd. I remember once in Paris he stepped out for cigarettes and the next I hear he's arrested for floating nude down the Seine - experimenting in river currents with a pair of yellow rubber water wings. Well, that cost quite a little bit of "enfluence" and "d'argent" to hush up, I can tell you. Harold, dear, stop playing with your food. Don't you feel well?
Mother. I'm going to get married.
What?
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
A rough estimate.
Yes. It does.
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
Thank you, Uncle.
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
What are you talking...
Then why are you here?
Where am I?
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
See what??
They were over here, Professor.
Nah -- he's taken care of.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
hound of resurrection --
Here. You'll need one of these.
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Son. About Rasputin --
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
It's her choice --  She's human --
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
Who's the squirt?
They're not speaking. Professor Broom had him grounded.
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
Don't move. We --
Professor, that girl you were talking about --
Anything else you --
Alone?
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Just take it slowly.
Christ!
That your daughter?
Lucky man.
It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
He doesn't see us, or hear us. We belong to you, Kirsty. And you to us.
No time for argument.
Nobody escapes us.
You remember.
One last time. Give me the box.
Julia.
Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
What?
Not know.
This is what began it.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
So where's the harm?
Well we can't just stay here --
Where's Daddy?
We're going to freeze to death.
I thought half of it was your brother's?
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
Where are you?
You're NOT going to faint.
Would you excuse me? I think I'm going to go to bed.
Larry...
Just soda.
This isn't the bedroom.
I suppose not.
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
What's wrong?
What happened to me?
I'll get the doctor.
I've forgotten.
I love you, honey.
Maybe you should give it some time.
What?
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
Where are you going?
I won't be able to stand.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
Oh no?
'Bye.
What are you doing?
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
Suck my ass.
You are not in a band, Barry.  You are not a musician.  And no posters.
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
What?
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
Uh.  That's me.
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
Hey Charlie.
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
'Morning, Dick.
Can I do anything?
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
I think you know that.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Is what better?  Better than what?
I haven't felt like it.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
Sure they are.
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
Who the fuck's Pig?
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
When are you going back?
But what?
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
More confident, maybe.
Harder.
Wanna go to dinner?
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
I know.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
Fair enough.
About what?
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
It's true!
It's a crematorium.
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered.  Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo.  But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself.  And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
Oh, right.  Alright.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Sixty.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
We're not there yet, Justin.
Maybe he's hiding from something.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Didn't look like it came from "Toys-Are-Us", that's why I called you.
There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
I don't follow you.
Do you play?
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
He was innocent.
What about me?
He sees me as a threat.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
When you finish, what then?
Yes.
William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
I must be insane.  Leaving work, ditching cops.  All to follow a murderer.  A very old murderer, but a murderer just the same.
Why are you here?
Sometimes innocents become involved.
You've been a busy little beaver. Especially with that records mess up in Church Hill.  Your notes are very complete. Naturally my feelings were crushed when you didn't rush right over and tell us what you knew.  In fact, we're considering book- ing the ambulence chaser as an accessory to murder.
What's all of this got to do with me?
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Corey, you _owe_ me.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
You're a long way from Inverness.
You are the same?
Does it change with me in the room?
He told me there could be only one.
This is madness!
But we cannot be killed.
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
Impotent cow.
You have a gift.  One you must protect.
As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.
I feel hardly nothing.
But why be so concerned about me?
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
Finish your prayers?
Complete your inspection?
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
Here.  The hook should go just below the head, where the meat is toughest.
Figure she's with him?
Spare a chair?
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
I want you to come to me.
What are you getting at?
What were _you_ looking for?
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
The resemblance is amazing.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Nothing to be sorry about.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
What's the idea of locking this?
Seventy-five.
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
But --
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
Hildy! Where's mother?
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Mother? But your mother --
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Well, she'll know some day.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
Sweeney.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Then what does he want with you?
Allow me.
How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
All the words you've got.
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Then why are you doing it?
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Walter!
What would you do if it was a daughter?
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
It'll be Heaven!
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Anything you want, Boss.
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
There's money in it, Cooley.
How much?
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Well, that about covers everything.
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
Give me a hand with her, will you?
You guys wanna play some more poker?
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Where is he?
Pete, I want to talk to you!
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
Shoot to kill, I said.
A sight for sore eyes!
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
Got you, Williams!
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Phone for you, Hildy.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Certified, eh? Who is it -- your milkman?
Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back. 
Look out, you --
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Kings and sixes.
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
Isn't that her picture?
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
A very fine-looking women.
Baldwin -- his name is.
Why?
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
Grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
Bloody.
Well, for the baby, really.
Big Berthas, shelling France. Twenty-five-mile range, they have.
They send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. Each shell costs as much as a Ford 8.
Air-raid?
What kind of war is this Mac?  Up there in Cumberland, we never see an air-raid. The worst problem I have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. When I rode in against the Turks, I knew what it was about.
What about it?
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
So you're going to be a grandfather.
What's that?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
When do you think you'll get leave again?
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
What is it, pet?
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
It was the best time of his life.
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
Ma, Tiny's in.
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Take his gag out, it's more fun with the screaming.
What about the tree?
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
That's not something to joke about.
What?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Take that, you fucking slut!  Fucking redneck whore!
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
The Duke?
You mean John Wayne?
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
What was that?
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
Go around him.
Forget it. I'll just go.
How much is a person supposed to stand?
Quiet.
What are you doing!
What I need are some answers. 
Hmmmmmmmmm?
And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
Hmmmmm.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
Oh.
So.
Why?
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
Geez, he never gets tired does he.
What? I didn't hear anything.
A couple hours!
Keys.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
I suggest you kids leave now.
Why? Why are you doing this?
Grampa... watch the language.
Jesus Christ.
Well, all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls Dr. Satan.
Aw, fuck.
I guess not.
I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You and Mr. Willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything.
Tell him, Harold.
I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
Is everything fine?
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
When you were a little French girl?
Shall we close up, then?
I am sleepy.
What is it?
Urgh.
Like what?
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Be still my crotch.
Yeah. My brother told me.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
What are you doing in there?
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
What?
He looks perfectly fine.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Who is it?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
Your entire body?
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
I'm trying, you know.  I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
That's great.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
Really?
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore!  Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Yes.
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though.
Check!
Give me a bottle of beer.
I'm ready.
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
All I want's the money.
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Do you really think you can beat him?
Will you take a check, Bert?
Yeah? Why?
I lost twenty bucks.
You being cute?
I got drunk.
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
You know everybody, don't you?
You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
So does Eddie.
Well, we won't.
Sure.
How do we stand?
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
I can beat him.
I got time, Bert.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
Half.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
Yeah, that's right.
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
Go to hell.
With what?
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
You gentlemen care for a drink?
There it is. I'm broke.
Yeah, sure has.
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
You're a pretty good player.
Couple of bucks.
Can I sit down?
I used to be an actress.
I'm not.
So why go to college?
What do you do on the other days?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
You told me.
Mm hmm.
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
Eggs. How do you like them?
I've got something in my bag.
Haven't you opened it?
You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
Is that what makes a winner?
You need the words?
You glad?
Nothin'.  Want another drink?
No, I want to walk.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
California. Oakland.
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
What about... now?
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
Have you always had it?
Yes.
Who?
Emma...
That sounds charming.  Did you meet any interesting people today?
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
Only got one kind.
Son ... are you awake?
... and Rigel.
Which one's that?  The dull, red one.
What, Jim, what?
Where's your car?
You know, it really is beautiful up there.  Let me show you.  We'll take a walk after dinner.
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
But it's not, Jimmy.
You're looking for life?
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
What's his family background?
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
You're being paranoid.
What?
Love was never our problem.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
They don't know this.
It's perfect the line is busy?
You punched the President in the face?
We've gotta burn the rain forest, Pops. Dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. Maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
Pops, you're a genius!
What're you doing?
Nice meeting you.
Where are they?
But what, General?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
Really? You don't mind?
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
No. Exotic.
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?
I don't believe it. They make you learn how to fly everything from an Apache to a Harrier and still they turn you down? What else do they want you to learn?
I shouldn't have left her.
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
We must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
All my life!
What has the old fool got himself into now?
Ah, Venice...
How's the head?
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
Are you expected?
Tapestries?
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!
Yes?
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
What are you going to do?
Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
You did!!
Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
I ought to tell you something.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
And do I detect a rebuke?
Well... I can't think of anything.
Those people are trying to kill us!
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
And why were you trying to kill me?
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
Who?
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
Dr. Jones.
You got the tickets, Short Round?
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
You will go to palace there.
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
The old man saw it in a dream.
And then they took their children.
A what...?
Don't let it curl around you!
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
What about the future?
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes...
No -- don't you see -- crawling --
Oh no -- oh no!!
WILLIE?!
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
Wait -- what're you doing?
I'm going down.
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
What're we going to do?!
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
Al.
I just got here.
Where are we?
Why don't we go home?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Me? What'd I do?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yep.
You're not crazy.
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
Why not?
I'll tell you what to say.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
I don't know...To get Al.
What do you mean we.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Sue them.
Which way do I go?
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
You need ID in there?
What am I supposed to do?
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
Who cares?
Eat it.
I don't want to eat it.
...Joe.
Where are you going?
To the hotel. To register.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Rene...
What's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
You really like that shirt?
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Follow that busboy.
He recognises you, throw him off.
Joe, be careful!
They're all in it.
You got any books in there?
Is that all?
No. What do you hope? AL  I hope. I just hope. That someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. And you got no one to help you. And you depend on me. And you know what I'll do?
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
Ow!
Not sure at all.
Do it.
Are you alright?
Now, you're too suspicious.
Awwww...
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
JOE What abilities...?
It'll remind me of you.
I'm...scared.
What kind of a deal?
Let us get to the border!
I knew you were trouble.
In him?
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
How about a deal?
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Bit expensive, sir.
We met on the beach.
That name's familiar.
And...you know Jan Gruner?
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Just give me the keys.
About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
What's what?
Nothing.
Oh...and who is it!?
...Blake
Dinner...tonight.
What's so funny?
I am sort of scattered.
Who do you work for?
Why did you leave?
What did you tell them?
No, he didn't do that.
You know where he went?
One chip?
Oh sure.
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
What?
...across THE BORDER. Come on!
I can't fly it.
Are you alright?
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Do something!
You are, I've seen you.
Yeah...I have to get away.
Why are you on to him?
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Yes.
Look, nobody knows we did it.
What's that outside, Daddy?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Where?
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
How long?
Three hours.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
It's drawn from a selectively circulated...
Shit...
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
Since when has the paragon of investigative journalism allowed lawyers to determine the news content on "60 Minutes"?
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
Okay. 
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Hi, baby.
Oh, c'mon, Lowell. This is The New York Times. I don't know...
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
Soy sauce...
I don't understand.
Thank you, Bob.
"60 Minutes"?
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
Has he decided to go public? Because let me tell you, we've been doing this for three years now, and we've worked with a lot of corporate cases involving whistle-blowers, so we know... Big Tobacco will do everything in their power to stop him. So, is your man truly committed?
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
Who are these people?
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
Lowell!
C'mon, it all worked out. You came out okay in the end...
Did work.
Did work.
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
...okay.
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
No.
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
Lowell, I can't afford --
I'm going to be a witness for them in their litigation. So I'm going to fly to Pascagoula to give a deposition...
What's changed?
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
No? No, what?
ABC...?
That's not the point.
That's bullshit, Jeff!
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
What about now?
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
What do you mean there is no family?
And, so, I moved out... I see the girls a couple of days a week...
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
Jail?
You threatening my family, now, too?
So she's uh, flourishing?
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
You're in a rush.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
Got any symptoms?
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
My God.
Yes?
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
So who'd you hire?
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
But you don't agree?
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
Have you tried the duck?
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
Me. Yes.
She didn't love you?
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
Friends?
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
Huh?
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
I have a surprise for you.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
That's blackmail.
Hello?
Please! Leave the house.
You were going to have this thug...?
Sweet.
Hello, Rex.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
He never even asked. He just assumed --
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
Who's she?
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
Well, that's about to change big time.
Excuse me?
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
Sorry.
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Let me tell you something about Patty.
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
Oh, no, sir. No different than—
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and me—those things give me a stiff pain.
Yeah.
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami—  for the love of it?
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for—
We'll go into that some other time.
You were taken for a buggy ride?
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because—
Where are you taking me?
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
You only met him once .
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
I knocked several times.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much.  We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New York—and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
Here, boy!
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
Your ego is colossal.
That, I suppose, makes everything—uh—quite all right.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
Who are you?
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
Hey—you're little, aren't you?
Egg. One egg—doughnuts—black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
I thought maybe—uh—"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
No. No. It's too good a story.
I'm following you.
I wish you'd stop being playful.
Of course it is.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride—
Not a one.
You're prejudiced.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
Well, take them off.
What!
Oh, Peter— 
What's got into you?
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Amazing.
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
Better go back to your bed.
Same to you.
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
Yes—if he is your husband.
Why, he'll be back.
Serves you right. Oughta be careful who you take up with on the road. You can't go plyin' your trade in my camp.
Oh, by the way—what's your name?
I've been thinking about you.
Hey—you not up yet? Come on—come on!
Huh?
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Get out of here!
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
ain't got a hat—
Mush. Mush.
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
Well, you're two up on me now. 
There's a seat over there for you.
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
Thanks. 
What?
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to—
Huh?
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
And Oswald?
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
Who?
Bill.
No, I'm not...
What do you think, Lou?
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
...there were about nine or ten people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing some stuff in the bush with him. Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a mess,  Y'know he had all those mice cages around cause he's working on this cure for cancer... Dave's smart - real smart - speaks five languages, knows philosophy, medicine, military history, politics.  He wanted to be a priest but they defrocked him 'cause he was queer...
But why?
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $1 billion for his Texas friends, Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam. That's just for openers.
You know damn well who it is.
Calm down, Dave, what?
...give me protection?
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
I believe the boys got a couple.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
And Shaw?
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
I'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom.
No.  I had guns all my life.  I used to go turtle shooting.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
Aren't you being a little hard?
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
A Willie O'Keefe?
Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald?
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm tired.  I've had enough!  They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking.  You're ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
Huh?
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
Time?
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Maybe we should just call it a day, Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a little behind.  We got two people killed, maybe more we never thought about.
Chief, I've had my doubts about Bill for a long time.  He's fighting everything.
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Yes.
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, you know - heart attack, wasn't it?
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
The assassination, Jack?
What's the problem?  What's the problem?  Do I need to spell it out for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
Germany.
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
Do you walk home?
I understand.
Who?
You see, it works like this. You get your ass in trouble, I get your ass out. That's my job. And I don't mind tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
Three years.
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
Great, you're here.
She wants to make a deal.
What's she willing to give us?
I'm not a loser.
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
Are you really a bail bondsman?
I gave you my card there.
I'd love one, but not there.
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
Was she helpful?
That would be Beaumont Livingston.
What'dya think?
Somebody loan it to you?
This is pretty.
Does something else worry you?
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
Why?
Bring the money in and they follow it?
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
You don't actually do it that way?
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
What about you Max?
You're avoiding the question.
When did you decide?
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
Tell him I want to give him his money.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
I never lied to you.
Madrid or Barcelona?
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
Sometimes every day, for a while.
He say is a surprise.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
You two meet?
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
What for?
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
And splittin' with her?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
I thought I did.
So what happens now?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
Beaumont Livingston.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
Didja tell 'em anything else?
Managers get ten percent.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
What'd you care?
How do you know she did that?
You okay?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
No.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
I'm carrying it.
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.
C'mon in.
I'm in my underwear.
Who was that?
How much is there?
Sure.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
It's Louis.
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
You couldn't just hit her?
How much it there?
Look, I swear to fucking god, she came out with that bag and I took it from her.
Then what?
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
What?
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
Cops can't locate him, huh?
How can I help you?
Gonna have to put up cash.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B- I-E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton 90222.
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
I got some more business for ya.
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
You didn't hear?
Was she?
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
What's up with this shit.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
And where's Jackie?
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
Turn left.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah.
Yes.
Where do you want to go?
Dr. Singer. It's been a long time.
Something weird is going on here. What is it about us? Even in Nam it was always weird. Are we all crazy or something?
You're hurting me!
That's right. We did.
They're not interested, Jake.
Maybe there's a larger truth.
Gabe?  What are you doing ... ?
It was the window.
Don't go.
What do you mean, demons?
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
Who?
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
God almighty. What did you do to me?
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
But I see them.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
I'm not cold.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman ... You know who it was?
I don't want to know.
Go to sleep.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
They stole it.
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
You up?
Who? Jed?
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
Is that the one who died?
What's wrong?
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
They weren't human!
Can't you stop it?
What does it say?
Look at me. I'm ice cold.
Don't gimme that.
Sam, Tony, come in here.
Remember that.
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
While you were in the shower.
What? What do you mean?
What's he talking about?
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
I promise.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
You look upset.
Mid-town mostly.
I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
WHO ARE YOU?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
The Ladder?
Anyway, this big offensive was coming up. Everyone knew it; Time Magazine, Huntley-Brinkley. And the brass was scared 'cause they knew we couldn't win. Morale was down. It was gettin' ugly in the States. Hell, you remember.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
One drop?
Well that's good to know.
No. I couldn't.
Please come quietly.
No. No. You haven't had any visitors.
A long time.
Jesus, man, you look terrific. You must have put on twenty pounds.
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
I don't know.
Who is?
Who, Paul? What exactly ... ?
You've seen them?
I don't know. I don't know.
That sucks. Why won't he go down?
Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
Minimal.
Can't shut em' down from here.
Hey! I'm not ready.
Then what do we do?!
I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
You just keep an eye out.
Pull me in!
Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
What's this?
I couldn't save them.
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
You lost the charge?
Now this is getting exciting.
Later.
What are you doing?
I'm just saying.
I don't know...sorry?
Do I have to?
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
Guys, please come with me!
He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
What do you mean 'We...?'
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
Did you get him in the head?
Older, sillier.
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
Can you stand something to eat?
Michael! Come inside!
What'll I tell the kids?
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
Only 24 hours!
I was acting in the town's best interests...
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
What d'ya mean?
Why don't we just tow it in?
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!
What day is this?
You picked her up on the ferry.
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.
Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him.
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin?
What have you got there, Lenny?
I've got all these signs here...
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
I don't think so.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
Hey Bleek.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
Okay, cool.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
What a trip, man.
No... I guess not.
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Oh.
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Why aren't you at work?
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
I know what junk is.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was?
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Uh, thanks.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
What?
Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
What's the matter?
But I thought you'd be cool if...
Nothing...
Is the baby okay?
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Please stop now.
Tore up from the floor up?
Maybe you're having twins. Maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice!
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
I am a suicide risk.
Dude, I'm pregnant.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
Aw, please Junebug?
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
You sound shocked or something.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
Obviously, we'll compensate you for your medical expenses.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
She answered our prayers.
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
You took this picture?
That's me.
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
Early, what're you doin'?
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
What's your name, boy?
Vernon, Florida.
Turkey mostly.
...Mind if I hold that Bible?
Dahlia, no.
If you say so.
Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
A book on the warehouse murders?
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
Carrie.
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
Brian I want him out of our car!
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
How old you?
Umm. Altogether?
Yes.
With how many people?
Shit.
Oh man, that's the best.
You know what else?
What?
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
To what? Virgins?
Shit.
What do you want?
Are you hungry?
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
Yep.
I hate this game.
Why I do what?
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
You are?
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Right here.
Where you goin' tonight?
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
Hey. What are you doin' right now?
I thought you had a girlfriend.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
What is it?
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
Because, you know why. You know.
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
I tested positive?
I'm sorry.
Because gee, you don't look OK. I mean you're a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...
Thanks.
Telly says was up.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
I'm coming.
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Yep.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
He still does.
You've heard the stories right?
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
Shh.
Not too late.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
Right.
Yeah.
I've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
By yourself?
Casual.
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
What?
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
It'll take hours.  You can't make me do this.
You think he's dirty?
We wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
Did anyone look suspicious?  Think!
Who is this?
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
What word did you leave last night?
The police haven't told you?
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
Nope.  Nothing.
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
Okay.  Nice meeting you.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
How long has she been dead?
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
Well, I think you have to play to his ego.  He thinks he's superior.  The more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
We're going to work on the message.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
Ten days ago.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
Yes.
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
That's not fair!
You have to win every point, don't you?
Can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
Wasn't I just talking about me?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
You can turn everything around so easily.  This is not just another game, is it?
Nothing.
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
About what?
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
Yes.
You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
Turold's son was to marry her.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
I have no extraordinary powers.
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
I can't reach her.
What do you see?
No. She must agree of her own free will.
Traitor! She'll marry you in hell!
They will hold Lyssa in the Center of the Vortex, the place of the Beast, where its power is greatest. No man can match it there. Lyssa must try to move toward us. For as we enter the Vortex and move closer ...
She can see the Beast!
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
Fame.
These we'll pay for.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
I have a cinnamon bar.
But also very young. Six to one is no odds, boy.
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
He will come for me.
Freylag's stronghold?
Can you see?
We'll seek an Emerald Seer. They have great powers of vision.
I must go to the widow. Perhaps she will help.
Perhaps she will not kill me, for I know her name.
Each to his fate, lad.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
But you would not stay with me.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
No, she was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
Knowledge.
...Good...  But what's special in him?
Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
No, no.
It's incredible! How did you do it?
No.
When I say I love you.
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
Where are you going?
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
Yes?
...Composer.
Huh? Why?
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
What is it?
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
Oh the preacher's getting angry again...  Tell me something.  Did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? Were you there to help her?  Or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
Just for curiosity sake that's all?
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
What it is -- is the truth.
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
The beach of Pacifica, California.
What did they ask?
Red flags man.
Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
Jumped where?
Nine.
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Each inch represents 150 miles...
What are you saying?  This story is too big for this paper?
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
She knew you loved her.
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
I haven't been too punctual with the rent.
Is it a boy or a girl?
Hello.
What do you mean?
It's yours.
Sparkling apple cider?
No.
Hello.
You're pretty drunk.
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
You OK?
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Yes.
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
I'm going to fill it right now.
That's impressive. How did you do that?
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
Thank you, Sera.
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
You know I love you... yeah?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
How much, do you think?
I've been all right.
Harvard Law School?
That's right.
Are we done for today?
You took my class in LA. You had the best high kick I've ever seen. Are you one of my lawyers?
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
Did you get it?
I do. I'm not allowing it.
Why didn't you call me?
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
You ready?
God, that felt great!
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
Uh -- family.
Relation?
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
Donovan asked to see you before you leave.
And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.
But maybe it's not what you think.
So?
Okay, how would it work?
He's gay! Enrique is gay!
Up for a celebration dinner?
Is he the only one?
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
What're you doing here?!
I don't know --
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
Good. Good.
Why do you say that?
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
There he is!
Then we smash 'em?
We come watch... we come watch...
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Why have you brought me here?
Kill me... I want... so nice...
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
What will become of me then?
You're a beast!
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
No, wait... please... listen...
Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
There it be, lad.  The Lindfarne Mound.  Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
Shhhh!
Damn them!
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Aye!  That too.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
Track the demon to his lair.
Aye.  Said to follow it to the edge of night.  But is this the right bird?
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
The wound is mortal.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Hey!  Stop it!  I can't see.
Never show mercy!
Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
A good day for singing...
Go on... go on...
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Well done, lad.
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
Tis a fair question.  If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
Where are you going?
Who?
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Its powers are strong.
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
What?
I can't see a thing.
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
Courage, Jack.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
Be fair, Oona.
Heading north still?
Up ahead!
Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
A castle's but stone and mortar --
And we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then George taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color I liked best!  And he said he loved me!
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
Mom said I should.
Are you his friend?
I'm living here while I build another house.
What's today?
Hey.
I don't want you to!
Why are you so stupid?
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
I thought I was helping you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
How's your wife?
Forty.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
It bugs me.
No one would blame me if I left!
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
I'm not doing it!
It'll be fine.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
Where are you going?
Did you got through my pants?
You're too fucking late.
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
I know the feeling.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
After everything.
She seemed upset.
We're all dying from the start.  I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
What kind of house?
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
It's okay.
What are you doing?
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
Where have you been for a week?!
Four days.  I left to think.
Kurt's been feeding him.
But you can't call me while you think?
One of you would end up dead.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
I dreamed about your house last night.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
Are you going to kiss me?
Been thinking?
Nothing.
He said he heard hammering.
I never asked for more.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Queer.
What did you say?
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
A night in the hole?
He's a big one.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
These are free papers.
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
Yeah...
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
She got married last month.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Sure, boss.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
Comfortable?
I know it begins with a "C"...
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny?
Nothing.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
My daddy gave me this watch.
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Alright. You want some pie?
Reward?
Still got that ten dollars?
That jelly you were talking to right here?
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
Man, this is gonna delay everything. Spanky's gonna be pissed.
What's up, Ray?
Claude.
What do you want, Claude?
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
Hundred and Sixty First Street? That's Yankee Stadium.
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
Back to New York for starters.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
What'd you say?
No, this ain't gonna work either. It's half chocolate, half vanilla.
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
Alright, listen up! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double! Let's move it!
Hey, the dude's holdin'.
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
1932? That's like, that's like...
Is everyone here?
Wait for the firemen!
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
Is there any truth to what he's saying, Pike?
Yeah, it's getting late. I could sure use a bath.
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
Apparently, your sister died.
Where'd you get this?
Let her go.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
...their damned souls will be ours.
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
It is awfully hot down here. How do you manage to stay so cool?
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
What is it?
Oh my God, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
Everything's fine, pop.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
Hey.
Bus?
You know, I was the one who created Hell.
Your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
What's with that guy?
Schnapps...
The South.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Basically, yeah.
Hey.
I think I'm floating.
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
We're going to Jersey?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
For me? Better feel sorry for yourself, Sandman!
All right -- what are you?
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Just the face.
Do you have anything special in mind?
Just wondered... what happens?
No, but at least I wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
What the hell took you so long?
Did you ever see anybody renew?
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
What's wrong, Available?
No.
What Quad do you live in?
If you did know, you'd tell me.
I'd rather be with you.
I have.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
Are you taking me to them?
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
You think Sandmen will?  There's no other way for me,
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
Don't ever let go.
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
All this. All of it.
I'll make the arrangements.
How did you get here?
Well? How do you like it?
You're not contagious are you?
Pete... You okay?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
You recognize that guy?
Yeah, I remember.
Can I call you?
Pete?
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
So what do we do?
In pornos?
So, should I call Andy?
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.
We saw you that night, Pete.
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
I want to see him.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
What is it?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Same one you were reading the other night?
When you didn't come to the club.
Called? When?
We've got to call the police.
What the hell is going on?!
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
I can see that.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Suit yourself, champ.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
What?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
Hey... Sheila.
Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
Two years!?
Sorry.
I didn't care for 'sister' last night, and I don't like 'Lovey' this morning. My name is Lovett - Alexander, P.
I see.
Yes. And who is he ? How'd he get there?
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
Don't mind Lovey. He's got the misery.
I'm thinking.
colossal nerve you have sitting there and talking about it so calmly - you, the swindler of thousands of people—
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
Oh, yes.
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
Centuries.
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
You must prevail upon him not to attempt the journey. He could never get through that country alive.
Of course, the porters will be very well paid - that is, within reason.
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
Are you taking me?
Sit here, near me. I am an old man and can do no one any harm.
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
Hurray!
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
George, what are you going to do?
You talk as though you intend on staying.
What are you talking about?
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of—
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
Maria?
I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
What was that?
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
Where were you hiding?
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
I wonder.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
All the time, sir.
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
Little more burn on the perimeter-they weren't roasting smores here. Dig out this hole a little.  Cmon, I know it's late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we'll all be home.
I wasn't scared...
What?  Who the hell are you?
Sir, you can't just--
It's a bug.
I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
Now what?
Kay.  All I'm saying--
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
I put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
Er. well, nowhere special.
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
Will it lower the curve?
Jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
Well, it wasn't in the jar...
Wally!
Is it now?
I can't.  I have to know.
Please, I want to go back...
I have to go back.
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
From where?  D.C.?
I put you away --
Yes, you did.
You made those tapes...
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
The nano... what?
... Graveyard shift.
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
And who the hell is that?
I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
Can you fake the cerebral output?
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.
Sir?
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
Sorry.  Old habit.  I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.  My father was a minister.  Lutheran.
You set me up...
Just go to the beginning!
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
She's a precog?
Rufus, play it back...
You gotta have faith, Dad.
It's a little late for that.
I forgive you.
You're not gonna kill me?
The precogs were wrong.
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
What's so funny?
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
The system would collapse.
I believe in that system...
Why should I trust you?
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
Sean --
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
We can stop him.
I don't know, why?
John Anderton was my friend!
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
That was our apartment.
Lamar Burgess thinks that you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.
I haven't seen him in two years.
They were grabbing her fucking ass --
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Yeah. Take it.
All the suites are about the same.
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Women?
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
I don't get it. What do you do?
He's okay.
Ricky's not wearing one.
It's daytime.
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
Who's watching the baby?
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
What'd you say?
There's no touching.
What's up. You all ready to meet Ruiz?
What's his name?
So, when's the drop.
How bad is it?
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
No.
They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
Where's Ricky?
This is it.
So, that's it. I'm out?
Ruiz knows about this?
You told him you liked him.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
What is it?
Where's the drop?
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
How am I being shitty?
Come on, man. Not with the owners here.
He implied it.
Please. I got three inches on you. You wouldn't have landed a punch if I didn't let you.
Fuck him.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
What are we delivering?
I like it.
It's not even yours.
How'd you unlock my phone?
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
You sure?
Yeah, I guess.
We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
I mean, that's what I heard --
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
You happy?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Look who's back? Want some champagne?
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
What the fuck's going on?
What the hell did you do?
We're getting whacked.
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
Let's do it.
Let's check out the penguins.
Wanna bet?
Eighty five.
It's gonna be fine.
Where do you get this shit?
Kinda. Yeah.
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
You look good, man.
Where's Spa.
Don't drag my ass into this --
You really in trouble?
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
Yeah.
I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
Sure. You boys want anything?
We're square.
Yes. You're going to New York.
So, wait, what are we dropping off?
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
Bet you like that shit.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
Where can I get a hold of you?
What?
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
You know it.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Man, what do you want?
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
Then the devil is white.
I will do it.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.
Let's talk about you for a change.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
Yes.
Yes. Did you eat?
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
Get some sleep.
At the Hilton. The girls asleep?
I'm tired of praying.
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
Is my family here yet?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Just what is your question?
What color were the original Hebrews?
Let him finish.
No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
Did you see the papers today?
The sentences to run concurrently.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
You the man.
You will, baby -- if the time come.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
The hell you are.
Yeah and get a slave, too, huh, baby?
That ain't bad.
I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best preacher hype I ever did hear.
Might be all right.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
What am I doing here?
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[Four-seven-four-seven.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[Drive.]
[I believe you.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[I want you.]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[The ransom was ten.]
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
What are you doing here?
The United States.
Why not?
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
Do you think he'll come back?
Did you sleep alright?
No.
The world of our children. How dare they?
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
For an American she understands this country very well.
You should be sleeping, baby.
You do?
It will be a hard break.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[Is that good or bad?]
[Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are.]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
Light. At the end of a long, dark tunnel. Somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Which one was that?
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
Where?
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
Who you gonna call?
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
I'm having a very good time, too.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
This is the kitchen.
Yes, I know.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
Nothing.
You got an elevator in this house?
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?
...so the whole book winds up, Mike Hammer, he's inna room there with this doll. So he says, "You rat, you are the murderer." So she begins to con him, you know? She tells him how she loves him. And then Bam! He shoots her in the stomach. So she's laying there, gasping for breath, and she says, "How could you do that?" And he says, "It was easy."
Sure, what?
Don't worry about it.
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
Marty...
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
I heard you, Ma.
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
Never this close.
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Stop him! Stop that man!
Back home.
Epidural hematoma?
You – must – open – me – up – again?
Wisconsin.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
He can't take much more time on the table.
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
We're a good team.
We think the same way.
Ravenous. What about you?
...And for our young men on the field of battle, that they may return home to their dear ones...
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
And there it is.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
We're throwing him a Last Supper. We came to invite you.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
On the contrary, I've observed he's not only a good technical surgeon, he's a good military surgeon. And that includes how a man dresses and how he bears himself and his sense of what it means to be an officer in the United States Army.
Listen, we look pretty lousy out there, right?
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
The one and only.
What do you do in the joint besides pimp?
Painless, you mustn't talk that way. It's a lot of crap. Cover for what?
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
What's wrong with you?
Yes, sir?
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
Don't do that, Radar! You make me nervous.
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Sir?
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
Huh?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
Uh-huh . . .
Ted Sheldon.
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Money.
Thank you very much for everything.
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
The letter from John Doe.
There is no letter.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
I got it all ready. Here.
Okay, fellows.
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Colonel!
No.
Had any schooling?
Baseball?
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
The heelots!
The heelots!
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
Well, I don't get it.
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started—
It's good to see you. Sit down.
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Say, who's putting up this dough?
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
They're not usually graduate students.
You're my hero.
You want me to go up with you?
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
How can I help you with the particles?
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
What?!
Who are you again?
I what?
Hi, Roper.
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
Alright, Roper. You want to come... come.
Yep.
We're already past it, aren't we, Kevin?
Only at the very end.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
Furthest point I could find from New York.
You don't like New York?
Is there something wrong with that?
You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
Where did you hear that?
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
You tell me.
To save lives.
You know why I like the track?
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
We won!
We won.
About six years. My partner took me.
McCall, you all right?
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
How's Paco doing?
There is?
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
Hmm?
Where's the damn wire?!
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
I'll provide you with transportation.
What do you need?
There are two million people in there with you.
They have nothing to do with this --
Okay...
Wake up?!
The patterns were moved around, but they weren't changed.
Not my problem.
You were the one who was dying.
Who?
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
One condition.
A hotel?
Who did he digitize?
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
Why would I do that?
Then how do you know about --
Realize?
Destination?
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Standard, modern, upscale --
Access established.
I can hardly walk...
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
That's pretty bad.
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
Two thirty three a.m.
... A falcon?
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
But boss, what about their parents?
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
THREE SECONDS!!
But I've never served a day.
I do right by Johnny Torrio and he does right by me.
Whatever you say, Boss.
No. Not everything.
What's the matter?
It's a mask.
You got something to hide?
It's too late.
Why? You're the innocent one.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
We'll figure out something.
Meyer.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
I been thinkin'...
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
It's not myself I'm worried about.
Come off it, Bugs.
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
I like that.
I'm glad ya come.
This business is about taking risks.
He's trying to make it.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
You can't kill me. You gave your word, Charlie.
Salvatore. My young Caesar. First me, Sallie. Then you.
I got partners.
Tell me, my son. Why did you go with Giuseppe? He's not our kind.
We learn from life.
I don't fuck my partners.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
Shuddup.
Jesus.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
Best we got.
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
What?
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Olive or eyeball?
<u>Why</u>??
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - I thought I would die.
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
Got a doctor on duty.
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
I might wake up.
I don't think so.
Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby brother...
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
How are you doing sweetheart?
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Oh--that again. Yeah.
What! Who?
Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
What do I play?
Did you like the first act?
Oh--yeah--
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
Yeah. Funny--
I apologize.
Okay. You don't mind?
Is the wind tired out there?
Well, let's get going.
What?
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
Kid--he thinks he's talking to that mob at home, but not a line we've written--not a word he's said from that floor has gotten into that home State.
What!
Yes, yes--phone, phone--  A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll look into this--  Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! Terrible!
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
Can't that wait, Hubert?
I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't hold a bird seed.
Emma! I'm a man at the end of his rope.
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
One minute! Just one minute!
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Me! Jim--how--?
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
A dirty frame!
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
Maybe you'd like to come along and watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a wonderful job with that leg.
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
When Jeff gets through with Taylor, Pop--
Washington!
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
Will the Senator yield?
For a question!
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
Will the Senator--
No, Jeff--please--!
Fine--
How's Amos, Ma?
Office of--Senator Smith?
--big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
A *day*!
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
Committee, huh?
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Why?
Have you always had to--work?
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
No--not today! Boy, I feel like a house afire! Saunders--how did I do?
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
Thanks a lot.
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
What are you going to do?
But--I've done everything I--
How are the pigeons?
Well--I--
The chair recognizes the rather strong- lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his bags and your own right over--and get yourself a room in the same place--
Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
Go away, Nosey.
Nice *compliment*!
Yeah?  And what else?
What do you mean?
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Jim, I won't stand for it.
You won't stand for it?
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith-- our new Senator.
His first 'whiff'!
Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?
Order!
No, no children.
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
And you saw them happen?
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Sure. I met you.
There's Times Square.
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
You said I was a lady in distress.
What did he play?
Let's just walk, okay?
Mary, I'm going home.
Are you? When?
Good night.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
Can I have a month's vacation?
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he—
Perfect! Perfect!
He's not home, I tell you!
Your Honor, I object.
But your honor—
Hang up.
I can't find him.
You can't?
Why, no.
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
Have a drink?
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
Sometimes it's the only solution.
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
Me?!
Uh-huh.
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
What kind of wife did you say she was?
No, I mean - about my client.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Well, I don't know. I—
No.
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
That ought to be fun.
South Dakota north.
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
Oh, I do too, sir.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
You try it.
How did they threaten you?
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
Uh-huh. What are they?
You can go out there if you like...
Uh-huh.
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand, Ernest. Did I miss something?
Interesting approach. What was his name?
What kind of doubts?
Where's your wife, Henry?
Do you want to come in?
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
I've had my moments.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
Tastes good.
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
Yes, your honor.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Got a license?  But no car?
What's happening here?
There's something I think we need to talk about.
Why don't you tell me?
Could I see Sofie, please?
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
Mom's such a cutie.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door.
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
Which thing?
That's one way to put it.
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
Yeah?
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Transference.
Which show was that?
Sofie...
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off.
Will you think about it?
Weekly or monthly?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
Really?
So, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... Is your problem really that you're... lonely?
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
It wasn't the best situation.
"Get to know your therapist."
Things got a lot worse.
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
We saved him! Saved him before the creature could finish his work. Now leave, all of you, quickly, before he finishes you all.
And what ritual would that be?
How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
What is he doing here?
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Fifty percent.
So who's the broad?
I just decked your brother
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA-- !
You know your history.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
Preparation for what?
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
No... Why?... Should I?
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
Then we'll have to find some immortal ones.
Don't do it, Evelyn.
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
That just makes you more gullible.
Do you really think he'll show up?
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
I found it, Evy! I found it
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
You did not!?... We're not!?
I know you knew I'd know.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
You two timing psychotic bastard.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
He's dead.
Superheroes.
I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy. In two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. It's the perfect time to switch teams... So what do you say?
They always call the great ones nuts.
Sure -- I guess.
Hi.
I admire you.
It is?
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
My heart died a long time ago.
So what else has Superman got?
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
There's a vague similarity.
Nah.
Sounds good.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
Mother... it's not what you think!
You did?
Or Batman --
We've got lift off!
And, what a delightful idea!
Ah -- you approve?
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
About 5,000 troops.
Any cannon?
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
Paris is evacuated, sire.  The enemy is to enter at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.  The National Guard is on duty at the gates.
I don't know, sire.
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
Impossible, I don't believe it.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
Well, it must be a good deal warmer than it is here on the street.
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
Are you sure that you are not still in love with her?
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
I know what you're doing in there.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
I couldn't face telling you.
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Good evening, ladies.  You must forgive me, my dearest wife, but I simply could not wait to see you.
Yes, I do -- very much.
We have a treaty with Austria.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
A message from Citizen Fouche.
Anything you need.
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
That's a nice piece of heat right there.
Where you going?
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.
Naw, I already ate.
Who is that?
Just a little.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
You better stop running from that girl.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
What we gonna do?
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
How you know?  It could be anything.
No.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
Huh?
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
I do.
What it smell like?
You coming in?
You too.
My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
I do.
Try an' hold it, man.  Squeeze your ass cheeks together.
He's inside the house?
Look, man, this is a big misunderstanding.  All we wanted to do is borrow some sugar.
Hey.
Call me.
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
I'll take you later.
Nothing.  What you want?
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
Huh?
I threw my back, again.
That's my girl.
What?
You just come in on Amtrack?
I...
I remember you...in the elevator.
That's right.
For not believing you.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
You get another chance in ten minutes.
Again.
I want'to talk to her.
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
Nods.
No. Kisses to you.
Please...
What?
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
That's pretty good.
You have, huh?
You're a big girl, huh?
Where is he? Did you lose him?
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
Yeah.
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
I'll bet.
Where's your Mom?
You understand?
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
No.
Don't!
Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Is he hit pretty bad?
Amen! Amen!
Why?
She's gone to Moundsville.
I'm hungry, John.
Dead.
Up river.
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
I mind you said there was two.
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
Yes?
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
O no! Your turn!
Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
Harry!
Get up, Willa.
It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
Them kids is yours?
You'll whip me!
When did I ever?
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Guess I did.
You believe in the Boogey Man?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Who?
My dream.
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
It wasn't that serious...
Where you think you're going?
Get into bed.
Great
No television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
What do you wear in the morning?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
That must be the one!
How are things in Moscow?
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
The Duchess...
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Good morning, Gaston.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
Your breakfast, monsieur.
Eight forty-two, sir.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
Good evening, Your Highness.
Count d'Algout...
Yes, Leon...
It's a real Paris reunion.
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
What did she say about me?
How much does this cost?
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
That's even better.
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
Will you send me some cigarettes, please?  Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State.  You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
Confess what?
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
I think so too.
Oh no. No visa.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
And what do you do for mankind?
Thank you. Thank you.
Ni-notchka.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
It's false sentimentality.
Was that talkative?
I must go.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
I didn't follow you.
Must one always be after something?
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
Would that make you any happier?
No music.
...but big.
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
You saw all that in one glimpse?
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Am I interrupting?
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
Months, Swana.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
I'm afraid that's what it is.
Hello.
Good morning.
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
This will do. 
The future of the common people.
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
My jewels?!
So ... let's go ...
How's the job coming, Bob?
We'll see about that ...
So, what about those Watergate clowns, John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy. Thirty-five-year sentences!  There were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries. There was no success!  It's just ridiculous.
Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon all of them.  Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
I understand that, sir.
To protect his people.
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
Pay him.
He's in the dumps, sir.  Agnew.  Every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America.
No, you didn't, Bob.
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
There's no secrets here, Al.
About a dozen.
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
Well, why not?
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
Yes, Mother ...
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
You're referring, of course, to chairing the Special Operations Group as Vice President.
It will take a little time, but I'll order a search for your papers. Though it does raise a disturbing issue.
Are you tapping Kissinger?
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
... little Bobby.
Can't we just talk here?  I've got the police chiefs in San Diego.
Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
Johnson had the same damned problem till he bugged his own office.
Kissinger?
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
Why, you got a customer?
Where'd you find him?
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
Well, as you know, most of my staff have weighed in against this "incursion."  They believe it will fail to achieve anything fundamental militarily, and will result in crushing criticism domestically ...
Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
It was illegal, what he did.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
We didn't come here to talk about football.  We came here to end the war.
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
No, no.  I'm not powerless.  Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it.  Maybe not control it totally.  But ... tame it enough to make it do some good.
So I'm supposed to be ...
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
Do you really want this, Dick?
Can I just ask for one thing?
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
Is that adjusted for inflation?  Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I called him a monster.  Now he could be our most important ally.  Only Nixon could've done that.
Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
And what am I doing?
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
Won or lost?
What?
Who else'd be in your truck.
I am older.
Yes, you've circled round.
I'm... discouraged.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
Try "old" on for size.
Well what would you call him.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
Who's he in trouble with then?
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
...You ride Winston.
...Now that's aggravating.
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
Sir, I don't want to picture that.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
I thought it was a car afire.
I ain't got the money.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Llewelyn!
Big talk.
Just keep it up.
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
Why all the way to Del Rio?
You can't afford one?
Llewelyn?
You know what's goin' on?
I know something better.
I can't say.
...Where's the transponder?
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
See about closing.
Now. We close now.
I could come back then.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
Yes I do.
This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
Call it.
Yes you did. You been putting it up your whole life. You just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin?
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
Good. I need everything else.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
What room?
I want you to take me to another motel.
Well enough.
What do you want to know?
Then you'll like me.
It's called a transponder.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
What did you do?
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Cast iron?
She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
Oww, the arm, the arm!
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
That's a nice name for what you need...
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
"Banners?"
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
I better go check on them.
Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late.  Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Yes, ma'am.
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
What?
Are you and Larry happy?
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Lyla's very nice.
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
I came for love...
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
I don't know.
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
I'd slap his face.
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
What are you doing?
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
What? Where was he?!
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
No, almost never.
Rosa...
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
Blake, I can handle that transplant!
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
I... I don't know...
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
What 'look'?
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
We can live with that.
What the hell was that, another statement?
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
We should go.
What?
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
I don't like talking bad about the dead, but now that he's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I wouldn't have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who defended him. And that's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry.
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
I said I'll think about it.
Would you say she was ambitious?
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
Yeah?
Thankee boys for throwin' in that fricasee. I'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
Waitaminute -
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
What do we do now, Everett?
Pete have a brother?
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
Where's your ring, honey?
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
That's right, honey.
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
You didn't know that at the time!
The preacher said it absolved us.
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
They lured me out for a bathe, then they dunked me'n trussed me up like a hog and turned me in for the bounty.
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
Well sir, my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul. We hear you pay good money to sing into a can.
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
Languishing! Goddamn campaign is languishing! We need a shot inna arm!  Hear me, boys? Inna goddamn ARM!  Election held tomorra, that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk!
But Pappy, they's inter-grated.
Mama said you was hit by a train!
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
Yeah, I know.
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
You're good.
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
What did you call me, boy?
Where are you from, boy?
Yes, sir!
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
Is your brother a flyer?
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
You serious about having him over?
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Seriously.
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
You stayed after all.
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
Are those for me?
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
Thanks for covering for me.
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
God.
You should see the look on your face.
Me.  I am.
Remember that.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
Get the fuck away from me.
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
Who is this guy?
Asshole.
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
Cell phone.
She's never coming out.
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
Cut it back a little bit.
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
No, Edgar Allen.
Yeah.
Shaky?
We're never getting out of here.
I was trying not to tell you...
What?
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
Like?
I can't... they don't operate that way...
Inspector Brimmer
Motherfucker... you stay away...
...Glad you came man.
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
Now hold on Rodgers...
Rodgers... this is no good...
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
Huh?
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
This cool the heat off you any?
You don't look alright.
Yeah.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed.
You don't know him very well, do you?
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Apology accepted.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Colonel will do.
I served in His Majesty's army in the French and Indian War.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
Yes.  He seeks a levy of troops and money.
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro.
You're in no condition to ride.
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
Where?
That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
It's Mister Marion.
I'm sorry.
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
Not held, just slowed down.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
Don't worry.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
Gray.
Remember Braddock?
Seventeen.
Father... I killed those men...
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
Yes, but the rope might be--
Honey, Church will be fine.
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
Ellie? What's wrong?
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
Is there quicksand?
You keep saying that.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
Shit! Look at this mess!
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
The movers--
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
There's ... another exit?
Now?
Looks like your back to having nothing to offer.
Do you believe him?
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
Miss Swann.
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
Curse you for breathing, you slack- jawed idiot.  Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping.  It's bad luck!
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
How did you get off the island?
Raise the sails.
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
What's your name?
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
Norrington, think about it ... the Black Pearl, its captain and crew ... the last pirate threat in the Caribbean.  How can you pass that up?
I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
I'll be at the wheel myself.
Somewhat.
Why ask me?
Agreed.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
Depends.
Miss Swann!  We're here to rescue you!  It's going badly!
Yes.
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
Pollution?
What did you use?
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
You mean besides kicking your ass?!
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
Why are there two ottomans?
That might work.
Aaabout...?
Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right?  I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
Smell?  Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
Sir, please try to hold still.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
You're insane.
Daniel, give him the Trix.
You don't know?
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
What do these replicators do to people?
Is something wrong?
Oh yeah, real funny.  Yuk-yuk. Let's laugh at everything a man believes in.
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Just giving credit where credit is due.
How far can you stretch?
No cheese.
That's pretty good.
Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff—
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane—  —goes out and counts the silverware.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
This way.
I knew your managing editor very well.
Huh?
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
Thank you very much.
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.
I bring a message from Garcia.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
Is that so?
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
I'm not quitting!
No!
Dawson, sir.
All right, outside!
You what?
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it—
Well!
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
How is her family going to feel about it?
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Nothing.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
I dyed one and washed the other.
My mistake - she's glaring.
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Yeah?
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
Fine, but kinda thirsty.
The name is Smythe.
You try it.
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Yes, sir.
It's haunted just the same.
A bird in a gilded cage?
Yes.
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
What?
Yes.
Have you got any make up?
Bud brought it to me.
Isn't it great how she's resting like that?
She's crying.
But I really should get home.
All night?
I told you, George. I'm not going.
Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
Really Biff? The keenest?
Sure is pretty.
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
... Why?
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
I don't believe it.
Okay, that's IT!!!
Rain.
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
Well--it was dark out ...
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
You're not allowed to lie.
No, not that hedge. The other one.
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
Owns the hardware store.
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
I could like kill a guy with these things.
What do you mean?
Me too. Sounds swell.
Not directly anyhow ...
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
You got the admissions letter.
Right here.
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
What's that like?
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
Rain.
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
BUD.
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
TV repair?
Yeah. TV busted?
Hey.
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
It's not cool?
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
-- what are you talking about, come on --
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Nothing.
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Really?
Where is she?
...yeah.....
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Uh-huh.
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
Me?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
....what....?
Hello?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
I need help.
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
This is not cool.
Are you telling me no?
They're not open yet?
I don't know.
Do you know them.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
Oh that's great.
...yeah...
I don't know.
...I don't know what you mean....
Hello?
Yeah......yeah.....
Do you wanna have sex?
This is funny.
I think maybe over a hundred.
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
How?
Your hand is bleeding.
Hello, how are you?
Can I ask how much is this?
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
What's that for?
You want her to call you Jack?
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
Like a psychiatrist?
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
Hey...Lance....can I.....
WHICH?
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
What are you doing?
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
You can't be late.
I'll see you there.
That's it.
Are you ready?
So...did my brother call you?
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
At your service, Count.
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
I have a proposition.
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
Good day, Marquis.
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
An innocent child is dead.
-- that was lust --
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
Go to hell!
Who's to say I did not?
Was it impotence?
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
Well...?
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
And --?
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
That's not our intent --
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
Not you too
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
There's no call for that language-
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
How much?
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
I wanted it
Not for me.
Yes?
He lied to me
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
You drink at 10 am, do you?
He personally asked you to?
Magic
Oh for Christ's sake-
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
Listen to me-
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
Good?! Good?! Words fail you at last! It's terrific! Now I'll have to do some shaping, of course, and some of the scenes aren't exactly . . . exactly . . .
What?
Uh huh.
Christ.
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Mank!
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
You're lying to me.
You talked to New York?
Yes
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!
You're not still mad at me, I hope
I think you better sit down
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
He's Christ?
Hey champ!
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
What's wrong?
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
Sure. What is it?
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Harder.  Take the towel off.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Huh?
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
Does that mean...
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
You don't talk very much.
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
What?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
Positive.
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
I took the kids to my sister's.
What'd you see?
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
OK. Talk.
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
Are you drunk?
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
No, you're his wife.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
Well, officer -- do your duty.
His wife took a trip.
Thanks.
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
She never left the apartment --
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
I can't do it even if he's gone.
But I'm not a killer!
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
I knew it!
I don't want to.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
She's just not the girl for me.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
What about this morning? Any developments?
I wonder.
What?
You can tell that from here?
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
Mrs. Doyle?
Who's Thorwald?
How's your leg?
Not too active.
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
That's good news.
You mean leave the magazine?
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
You mean "goodnight."
Maybe she died.
What's the apartment house number?
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
Inside stuff?
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
That's a suitcase?
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
I'll rephrase the question.
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
But you're not?
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Shut up. I'm all right.
Phone number?
What's that?
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Feel okay?
What?
Jim Stark.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
Smashed the front door.
No--
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
I don't think so--
Except yourself!
Son--this is all happening so fast--
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
No!
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
Where did you get the gun?
You remember me?
I know.  That's why I came back.
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
Who has?
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Isn't it crazy?
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
Here.
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
I need it.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
Hi.  I saw you before.
You going there?
It doesn't matter to them.
You were looking for me, weren't you?
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Sure.  Lots of times.
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
I don't know.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
Is he your friend?
He hates me.
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
What?
Are you and Mom home tonight?
Gabriel, let him go --
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
No, hey, I like your coat --
Tell me again.
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
NO!
You sold him out.
Get the hell off of me!
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
Don't say my name...
I don't know...
You shouldn't have.
I'm glad it was me.
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
But you were saying you were...
They won't recognize me.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to --
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
No gun.
Where the HELL did he go?
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
The Powwow Safe?
What?
Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke?
I got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
Thanks, sister. How are ya.
Fuckin' freezing.
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
Monsters in the gelatin...
It's a roach, guy --
What?
And a slice of pecan pie, right?
Oh.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
What, working security?
Alamo...
Ash... Ashley...
YOU TELL HER!
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
How'd you know I'd do it.
POP! That was My card!
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
That I should've picked you up?
I don't wanna lift crates.
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
Bullshit.
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
The black Beverly Hills. I knew this lady from Ladora Heights once.  "Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's the black Beverly Hills."
Who, Mr. White?
Yeah.
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Jesus Christ!
Mr. Brown?
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
Sure.
Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin' tunnels. Now she's gettin' this serious dick action, she's feelin' something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
Wong?
Why can't we pick out our own colors?
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
What for?
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
Don't ask me that.
Your name's Freddy something.
You almost killed me, asshole! If I had any idea what type of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
Follow you where?
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
Say-the-goddamn-words: You're gonna be okay!
Just hold on buddy boy. Hold on, and wait for Joe. I can't do anything for you, but when Joe gets here, which should be anytime now, he'll be able to help you. We're just gonna sit here, and wait for Joe. Who are we waiting for?
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
As opposed to good?
What's wrong with it?
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
So what is it?
Before you got here, Mr. Orange was askin' me to take him to a hospital. Now I don't like turning him over to the cops, but if we don't, he's dead. He begged me to do it. I told him to hold off till Joe got here.
Why!
If we don't, he'll die.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
You takin' his side?
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
And that's more important than finding Lednov?
Who shot who?
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
And this is Helen Carter.
We can't stay here!
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
It's going to Sonora.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
Who's Lednov?
I don't want to run short.
At the ranch maybe?
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
You know what she asked me?
Half of them are mine.
You're not bein' quite fair.
But I want to stay.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
Suppose I take a look.
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
Maybe I better start working on him.
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
Clay Phillips.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Maybe I could start you out.
You're so nice.
That's the end of the line.
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
Are you okay?
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
Shhh... It's okay.
No, stay.
Ray, run faster.
So, I see you're really into spooks.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
Where the hell are we?
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
That we should take our friendship a little further?
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
Feel that?
Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
I know, but I've been thinking --
Then what are we going to do?
I think so.
No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
Let her go, Cin.
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
Stop touching his brain!
What the hell are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Uh, uh.
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
How are we going to get them all up there?
In about fifteen minutes.
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
Professor, we need to talk.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Would you like to see the girl?
It says, "Ray."
BLOOD FEAST!
Hi, Mom.
Mrs. Sutphin?
You don't think...
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
MURDERED?!!
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
But Mom, the video's not over.
I'm so happy I could shit.
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
Don't wake the kids...
Let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
Mrs. Hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
It's just not your day, is it Rosemary?
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
Yes, but I lent it...
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
Certainly not!
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Sure I do.
When I wanted to.
I've come from Jacqueline. She needs money.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village —-	"The Dante."
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
Do you know what this is, Frances?
What did she want to know?
Yes, of course —— but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
But you have treated me that way.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.
I thought I might close up the apartment -- maybe get a place in Connecticut.
I'm going to find your sister.
What's that?
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
Why wait?
Please, Jacqueline.
Yes.
I have been at the library.
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
I can imagine.
My window - - through which I see the world.
I had begun to write again -—that's whet I was doing when you came in.
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything —— and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
But why come to me?
It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.
I suppose, Jason, that you'll speak for your friend --  -- and your poetry will speak for you.
Would they hurt her?
I haven't said anything of the sort.
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Ann?
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Graham is an unusual name.
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Would you mind?
You're in therapy?
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
What kind of personal project?
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
Who's Donna?
No.
The... interviews are about sex, Ann.
Like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. Anything I can think of.
I'm sorry this came up.
Maybe you want to go.
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
That's a good question.
No.
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
Subtlety?
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
I've told you.
But you're planning to be?
Yes.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Why are you ashamed?
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
Goddam right.
You son of a bitch!!
I have thought about it, yes.
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
So it was recently that you tried this.
What brought this on?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
I guess.
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Why?
I say it because it's descriptive.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
No, I didn't.
Because I never got around to it.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Why did you do that?
But why did you want to?
Did he touch you?
In front of him, Ann, yes.
I can't believe you did that!!
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
I was just trying to --
Bye.
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
The extrovert.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
Do I sit or stand?
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
Is that what he tells you?
No.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I've got to get back to the office.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
It hurts that you would say that to me.
God, you... you're mean.
I know. Will you please leave now?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
Where are the tapes, Graham?
What tapes?
God, you need help.
John Millaney.
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Where is this thing that attacked your wife?
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
So who changes?
I don't get it.
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
YOUNG MALE INTERN, TALL AND HANDSOME
Check.  The quacks are willing tools?
What's cookin', Bert?
You got it!
I know, I know, it's just...
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
Dentonvale has been sold.
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
We're the experts.
Out of self comes selflessness.
Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?
AN' YOU'RE A WEEPER AND A WAILER ALWAYS TREADING THE TOES OF THE GREAT GENERALLY SPREADING YOUR WEIGHT YOU'RE A SPITEFUL, HATEFUL ASININE CREATURE A PUPIL WITH NO SCRUPLES WHO KNEW BETTER THAN THE TEACHER
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
But they only think they're happy.
Poor Brad.
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
Fabulous!
YOU'VE GOT DIRT ON YOUR HANDS AND EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
So I guess that's it.
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
In Santa Ynez.  And I agree with you about Cab Franc.
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
Great. You look great.  You both do.
I can explain.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
What?
Um... seventy... something.
That's your problem, Miles.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
Hey Jack, hurry up!
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
If that's what feels right.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
What?
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
Where were you?
What'd Christine say?
Yep.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Nope.
Nice shot.
Obsessively.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
You have to tell me --
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Well?
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
What the fuck!
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Are you all right?
Hey.
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Were you ever going to say anything?
Hello?
Victoria.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
French or American?
Cabernet Franc.  This is only the fifth year we've made this varietal. Very few wineries around here do a straight Cabernet Franc. It's from our vineyard up in Santa Maria. And it was a Silver Medal winner at Paso Robles last year.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
What's the matter?
This one?
Daddy.
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
The same windows.
How can you say that?
What time is it?
What are you doing?
They're distracting us?
I can feel air.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
How do they know it's over?
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
These are D's; I need double A's.
Morgan?
Dad.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
What was the first thing?
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
No money, eh?
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
Where are we?
Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
Kate?
More than enough.
I just came out to say goodbye.
Are you all right?
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
I guess tomorrow at dawn he'll be proved right.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
They got a saloon there?
I understand.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
J.T.'s done everything he can. I married a brave man. Augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we're talking.  McKendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so J.T. can't even get the law enforced.
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
Where's your brother?
You wanted to see me?
I'm done talking. Get out.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
He was murdered.
Why come to me?
Why are they doing this, Mal?
I heard that too.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
You've got a legitimate job.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
Good old Paden. I was hoping you'd changed your mind about the job.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
It's the only place I'm happy.
I don't want you to get hurt.
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
Please.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
Even the fall from the plane?
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
She said you were very beautiful.
My two favorite girls.
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
How much wine have you had?
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
Hello, is this Elaine?
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
What I do to Simone?
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Body double.
For her?
I was misquoted.
Good for you, Hank.
Hi, Dad.
I'm sorry Mom canned you.
She still with Kent?
Me too.
Why?
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
Why didn't she thank you?
No, that was me.
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
Nice boat, Taransky.
She looks a lot like you.
Long live the First Amendment.
Mr. Sayer...
I don't understand.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
Yes.
Thank you.
You did create me.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
You know what I'm talking about.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
What was that you were saying before with your soldiers? Day pro fun.
You're a doctor. What kind?
How do you draw now?
He hates me.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
Something I want?
Dr. Crowe.
Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
Yes.
What do you want more than anything?
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Yes, I am.
Just help.
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
I wish I were somewhere else.
Really?
And you know what else?
They did?
They scare me too sometimes.
You see ghosts, Cole?
Cole, please stop.
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
What's a "little while?"
Looks like the alternator.
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
No shit.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
Wrong. Fratricide is when you gun down your brother. You're out. My turn.
How... was she "called?"
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
Amends...?
Never heard of it.
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
How does it feel, Keith?
Is that right?
Time for a little... "feedback" guys. That guy from Hectic Records --
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
No --
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
I almost thought for a second...
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
My father, he was -- he was real close to evil. People didn't know. Still don't. From the time I was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. I don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. And when I turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. Starla looks at Bill, who seems struck.
You took Bill.
What the hell are we going to do?!
Some kids found her necklace near Tipper Creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Yeah.
Hey there, Chief.
Meat.
Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
That's not true -- Where are you--?
I never danced in a towel before.
Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
Who's that?
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
When one sees you they all see you.
Get your hands off my daughter!
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
What the hell's going on?
Shoot.
Jesus!!!
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
How do you know?
What are you gonna do when you get home?
Well, thanks for the lift.
What are you thinking?
Yes.
I'll do it.
No what?
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
Also boring.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Oh.
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
-- Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing here, aren't I?  Shouldn't that be enough? That I made the trip?
Okay.
I was kinda hoping, yeah.
Fifty grand gouge. South shore hayseeds, this is why I never play Tahoe, or redneck Reno...
Y'ain't never had to wash another man's blood off, dig it out y'fingernails... Y'had us for that. Y'ain't ever made a real beef on y'own, shit as light in the ass as you are, I'll bet you ain't ever made anything more than a fuck'n fist your whole life.  So if you think I'mma let your lil' punk-ass, with the dirt I've done for you, in the eleventh hour, sell me off like some fucking field nigger, hand me up to the Feds like y'last chip, then you done gone straight out-your-motherfucking MIND!
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
...When did you know all this?
...Are you insane?
...So you knew all this and yet y--
Yeah, I can front this.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
True?
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
What's wrong?
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
What's the time frame?
What do you want?
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
How quickly?
He's dead.
Is there anybody else here?
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
Yes.
What are they?
Book?
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
You're better when you take them.
Is it a planet?
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
You don't want me.
You said he was dead.
What's happening to us?
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
I never said I didn't.
I can't stay here.
Who are you, then?
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
You live in Manhattan?
Beg pardon?
Let's get a drink.
You were reading my Renoir.
How did you know?
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
Yeah.  It was.
No dog.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
Not exactly.
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
Do you?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
I'd miss my life...
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
Nothing.
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Your what...?
Bought it.
What did she say the down payment was?
I'm sorry.
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
I just sat and listened.
Yes.
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
Watch your step!
Lay back, Mack.
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Flash, get lost.
I know.  I've got one too.
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
What if you get hurt?
Good morning, Liz.
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
Brrr.  It's colder than New Hampshire in here.
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
Yeah, Roz.
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
It's Friday night...
What the hell is that?
A bit melodramatic… but if you could prove it… that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
You're sure you're all right.
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Do you... live around here?
Up here, Docky Ocky!
Jawohl.
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Then we're all in on it?
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.
My legs are frozen.
It's on me.
You won't get off that cheap.
You are being rude again.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
It's a mouse trap.
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
Me? What if she don't want me?
To the Brick Kremlin!
Harry -- I'm blind!
So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
May I have this dance, Miss?
Betty! Betty!
You want to go?
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
What are you going to do?
What radio?
Stay out of it, Sefton.
If I were you, Sefton, I'd eat that egg some place else. Like for instance under the barrack.
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
Right.
You off your rocker?
What are we going to do with him?
I told you boys I'm no escape artist, but for the first time, I like the odds. Because now I got me a decoy.
You could use a new one yourself.
You can tell Father Murray to --
Yeah?
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
What did you say?
Are we going to stand around here and listen to him until the Germans find out where Dunbar is?
Give me the radio.
We have no radio.
Three hundred cigarettes! What is it you want from me?
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
From a chicken, bug-wit.
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
I get it. I get it.
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
Why would you want to leave?
Can I?
Close to retirement?
How can I argue with the captain of the Enterprise? What was the name of that planet=8A Veridian III?
That's right.
I thought you might.
Keep her together until I get back.
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Have Geordi and Data go over with the next Away Team. Tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.
They have found a way to penetrate our shields.
Status!
And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Will we get another ship?
Aye sir, coding now.
Why don't we beam it up?
Same sector. Metallic mass.
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
New orbit commencing... Coming up on sector three...
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
Yes, yes, Spock...
We are secured from Warp Speed... Now entering Genesis Sector of Mutara Quadrant.
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
About a dozen officers and men.
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
As surely as if it were my own!  Harry, give me back the Enterprise! With Scotty's help...
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
Who is this?! How dare you --
You should take the Vulcan, too.
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
... The needs of the few...
Bones!...
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
Understood, my lord.
Success, my lord.
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
And who am I hiding from?
This is completely improper, Commander Chekov. I have no intention of allowing Reliant or any other unauthorized personnel access to our work or materials.
Carol!
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
I've tried to warn you. Scientists are always pawns of the military --
I told you! I told you I saw a --
Why didn't you tell me?
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
Is that what you came here to say?
They won't --
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
Tactical!
Yours... is... the superior...
-- But I wanted you to know first who it was who had beaten you: I, Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you attempted to cage forever.
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
Carol Marcus --
It literally is Genesis...
Not much, Admiral. We have partial main power...
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
The ship -- out of danger?
I never took the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u> test -- until now. What do you think of my solution?
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
Any suggestions, Admiral?
You earned it.
I did not think so.
That was close --
Stop engines.
Certainly...
You lied.
You do this -- for friendship?
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
What do you mean?
Bones, stay here.
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
-- That's the general idea.
Wake up, man, wake up!
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.
What's your degree in, dentistry?
Captain... All systems have failed... We are functioning on reserve power only.
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
Like what?
My name?
No, sir. And no Federation wessels on assigned patrol stations.
Ah, well done, team 2.
Back to San Francisco.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
He's just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
You're upset about losing the whales.
... Who are you?
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
You tricked me.
Why does it have to be goodbye?
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
How do you know this...?
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
The tank will be finished by morning...
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
They did, Admiral.
You got us to the right place, Spock. Now all we have to do is get the whales out before we <u>sink</u>.  Mr. Scott, come in!... Scotty...?!  Damn... Mr. Spock, see to the safety of all hands.
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
With pleasure.
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Hello? Computer...?
It is kind of you to make this effort.
They are my friends.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
I know what a hologram is, Captain. The question is -- why would someone want to create one of our village?
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
An apprentice for thirty years.  We've noticed your people's mental discipline. Did that develop here?
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
There's a cavern at the base of the next hill...
Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean, you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once.  Do you like being a machine?
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Androids... don't have...fun.
Why not...?
Anij!
Will he live?
She's stabilizing.
Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills...
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
How many?
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
May I talk to you alone?
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
... had regenerated.
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
No, we're here to... rescue them.
Worf to Picard...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
No, sir...
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
Counselor?
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
All hands. Battle stations!
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
What are we waiting for? Let's go.
You think they're still up there?
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
I do not know what you are referring to.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
I have helm control.
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
I told you, there's no --
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
Always am.
What's still there?
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
You seem to have an answer for everything.
There is no invasion...
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
We?
I have to...
No... I'm from France.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Port battery, ready sir!
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Report.
Life signs?
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes!
Report!
Riker here.
Worf? Is something wrong?
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period...
You may need assistance, doctor...
We're not finished.
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
Still think we're finished?
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
We're explorers not diplomats!
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
Stand...?
WHAT HAPPENED?
For insubordination.
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
Just the size of my head -
They're preparing to fire.
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Sulu!
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
Me?
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
We HAVEN'T fired -
But we haven't run out of history just yet.  Your father quoted Hamlet: he called the future - "the undiscovered country"...
Uhura?
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
Not as yet, sir.
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
What?
What is it?
Too far off. Very near us. Perhaps... underneath us...
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
Starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record. We can infer he is relatively young and a capablecommander. He fought seventeen major engagements in the war. All successful. Beyond that, we know nothing.
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
How can you be sure?
But how can he? He'll kill you.
What do we know about the planet?
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
Sir?
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
New Praetor?
 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
Enterprise. We are the Reman Warbird Scimitar.
It would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
Sir, I recommend we raise shields.
No!
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
But she's not the Enterprise.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
I hope you'll forgive the darkness... we're not comfortable in the light.
Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
What happened?
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
You don't trust me.
Looking up at the stars.
If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
Why am I here?
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
The bond is broken.
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
You have one with two beds?
Do you have children?
What do you think of America?
No!!! No!!!
Where did you stop last?
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Mrs. Haydn...
Please...
Gear shift.
Space?
In your pocket, please...
It was yellow.
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
A baby is a new person?
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
Go?
You thought we were a different planet?!
The captain...
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Put that back.
Where did you learn that?
You promised you would get me to my ship.
Good morning.
You don't forget anything, do you?
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
Call the police!!
They after you?
This is crazy. What were we going to do if that had been the ship? We have two thirty calibre machine guns, three M16's and some handguns.
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
Doesn't make sense.
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
You know that's impossible!
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
Cut it out, Tran.
You talked to Iris?  When?
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
You think Tran killed her?
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
What kind of things exactly?
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
And he records it.  Thrill kill. Wants to see it again.  And again.
Faith OK?
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
You just did.
Yeah, but how'd it get to you?
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
About what?
It's alright.  He means it.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
That would be no.
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
What is it?
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
Is this great fabric or what?
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
See, it's all about what they see walking in.  A dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration... they'll see a trick gone wrong.  Random kill.  The kind you never solve.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Where we going?
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!
Are you out of your fucking mind?!
Tell me.
Well, look at the plus side.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
Are we under arrest?
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Um... he was older.
Have you had a chance to think about --
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
Who knows.
Hi there.
What?
A grill pattern.
I'm not in the mood for Native American wisdom.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
My God.
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
He was sitting here?
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
I'll relay this to CIIAC.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
The cut on your arm -- mind if we remove the bandage?
What I do requires confidentiality.
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
You are so fucked up.
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
Jesus.
Then there's the other issue.
That's my point. Remember, you're a cop pretending to be a deviant. It's not the other way around.
Jaime? Where are you?
You were right. He found me.
And you're working with him?
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
How do you know who's real and who's not?
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
I already have an employer.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
[Reality very risky.]
[Lionheart, what happened?]
I've been to Chicago.
I want to help you.
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
This is a first. You criticized the Deputy Director to his face and you still have a badge? You must have some one-of-a-kind skills.  Why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not going to get promoted, not wearing this jacket.
No.
I don't...
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
You like laughing at the misery of others?
What's that like?
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
To do what?
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
Charles! What's up, man?
Oh. You know.
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
...then ask where you met her...
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
You haven't told then, huh?
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
Oh, are we late? There are no clocks in this town.
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
Why not?
Who's your booking agent?
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
Why not?
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
I can call back...
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
Right.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
Hey man, don't sweat it.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
It's definitely a step back for me.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
Haven't you noticed I didn't mention Michelle once today?
I don't talk about her that much.
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
Oh.  Where is this place?
Sounds more like Aids...
What's that guy's name? Sue?
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
It's unbelievable.
Thanks, man.
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
Don't call me ever again.
Are you ready to order?
That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
I don't know...
Vegas.
Wake up, baby.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
You're gonna screw up our plan.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
What?!?
You gotta do it.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
Whatever.
No!
No, man. I need to use the phone.
She was hot.
Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
How?
See? And what does this guy she's with do?
You guys are such assholes.
What?
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
Bitch... You little bitch!
Because he's a bitch.
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
Now go over there and get those digits.
It's on.
The bear's got his claws back.
You don't have to wait three days...
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
You're staying home.  You're not going out.
Eat it, it's on the table.
Paulie's been a little sick all winter...he was home.
You think we'll go for that last place?
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
Are you worried about security for your million?
What is this nonsense?
Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
And now, what do you choose to do?
I'm going to finish school.
No.
Then why have I become a man like you?
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
Corleone.
Beautiful all over, eh?
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
An accident.  No one was hurt.
Will you give this to him.
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
What about McCluskey?
You know I love spaghetti.
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
How do you do.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
How's Mom?
All right, Mikey...who do we have to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?
What?
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm down at the hospital.  I came down late.  There's no one here.  None of Tessio's people--no detectives, no one.  The old man is completely unprotected.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
You'd say if you mind?
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge? Gray, actually.
Jazz, let's face it, it's just an insolent noise.
I'm never going back!
See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
Where do we find a carozza for the Forum, or can we hire any of them -- ?
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here -- perhaps we could split the rent on a house -- I'll get a job -- or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here --
How?
What evening?
Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks.
You should watch that!
Mr Greenleaf.
Yes it is.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
I hope she never knows.
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
What about Cortina?
Hello Marge.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
What?
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Just kidding. Are you alone?
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
Will we see you later?
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Well that would be even better gossip.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
And don't forget. I have the key.
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
What kind of people?
The moon?
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
The singer?
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
But... Betsy...
I see where Palantine got the nomination.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
With who?
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
What did you do?
Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
For a fee.
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
You carry a piece? You need one?
That ain't much of a name.
What's your real name?
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!
Well, I tried.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
He shoots dope too.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
Why not?
Why?
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
You don't have to.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
There must be something...
Sorry, sir. I didn't mean that.
No.
Sure.
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
I'm hip.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Wiz?
Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
Yeah?
Things got ya down?
Maybe.  Not really.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
I'll go.
What are you doing?
I'm not a fool, Billy.
What about you, Delly?
Dad?
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
Do you... remember me?
Nothing.  
Oh...
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Yes... yes, I do.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
No.  But...
What's that?
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
They couldn't wait to see you.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Ha!
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
Zackly.
Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
Any idea how you got here, son?
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
You kids off to the dance?
Who the hell is this "they?"
I know.  A Purple Heart.
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist.  Now, are you gonna play ball?
It's wrong, Leo.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
Cigarette?
I taught you that.
Is there a young Tim?
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
Ernie Cole here just got himself elected mayor.  Lost both his boys in the war.  Kenny at Anzio and Willie at Normandy.
You hungry, son?
No.  Absolutely not.
Miss Hayworth?
Cathy?
No. Just a few hours.
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
And the second?
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
They haven't harmed anyone.
I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds.
Darling, of course I do!
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
I don't know yet.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
What?
Yep.
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
I see. How do I get down there?
What name?
Are you sure?
How much for the phone calls?
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
And certainly pretty.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
Mother, get a rope!
I can handle it.
They won't be.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
Not by the thousands.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Well, where did he go?
Up on the coast. About sixty miles north of here.
What?
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
Doesn't what make me...?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
Yes.
I wrote the letter.
What did it say?
Yes.
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
It is for me.
What?
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
Some cream?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
Are you staying?
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Growing a beard...
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
When will they stop?
The power.
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
And he'll talk?
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
Help how? What do you want to do?
How?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
I want you to help my little girl.
I didn't mean it that way.  I meant only that I am not in a position to ask favors.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
But, Doctor, I only wanted to speak to you --
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
Dr. MacFarlane -- you remember the lady who came to see you yesterday -- the lady with the little girl?
Yes, I suppose so.
She's unconscious.
It was a woman when we put her in.
Not yet.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
I'll not do it, Gray.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
I would make you rich.
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
Yes, Doctor.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
Was that it? Well, ok.
Sssshhh. She's resting.
What Scar? What fucking scar?
Fucking Zombie.
The scar.
I heard you were looking for this.
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
Your father gave them to both of you.
I've been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. But what you're doing now, does. I don't know why.
... took everything I ever cared about. Left me with nothing.
Erin. Who?
I thought we had an understanding. I thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
Could say that.
Just don't believe everything you see.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
Yes -- of course.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Of course, dear.
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
He gave these to you?
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Where is that?
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
No -- I'm afraid not.
No foolin'? Will you?
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
The present situation?
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.
It's not your government I'm thinking about. It's your world.
Well, we could--
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
I've got some terrific news about your friend, Mr. Carpenter.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Oh -- hello--
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
Yes--?
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
Shut up!
Maximum body-count.
We are awesome monster-bashers!
What?...
Don't!  Stop!
Hey, take it easy.
Where's Star, David?!
With him?
Or a vampire.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
David.
Smells good.  When do we eat?
You have a T.V.?
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
I'll hitch.
I'm tired now.
We're getting close...
What's that smell?
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
You've heard this story before?
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Sam.  Is everything all right?
Where's Michael?
You're cute, Max.
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
I'm Michael.
Do you know where David took me tonight, Star?  Do you?!
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
It's gone.  I feel it!
Did you spill something?
I told you it was pretty weird Chinese food.
Mom's home?...
Michael?
Nanook...
What??
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Who are you calling?
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
Where these tracks headed?
What was he doing in the rec room?
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Too damn dangerous.
Watch Clark.
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
Let's open it.
Childs!  That a fuse?
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
Load of bullshit.
I think so.
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Thank you.
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
After all this mess then.
Gotta be from the Norwegian camp.
How many in their party?
We're on fire!
Don't let up, Childs!
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
It must have been hard, leaving your work.
What do you do on the towers?
The Hall of Books.
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
So, do we go on?
This is the way in?
Machines?
What do you mean?
End...?
Vox...
Alexander.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
Why would you let me go back?
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
That was a foolish thing to do.
And why not?
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
Admiration?  My my.
You know I can't.
Alex, what is it?
No, I'm fine.  I'm...  ... wonderful.  Just walking down the street with you again.
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
For God's Sake, David --
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
I know that --
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
How long ago?
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Thank you.
It has no purpose.  It's just beautiful... Does everything have a purpose where you come from?
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
You lost someone.
Yes... I suppose so.
Go back to your own time?
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Then if Emma turns me down will you marry me?
Might I ask why?
Sir, that curriculum is forty years out of date.  The students today are looking toward the new century -- they want to be challenged and inspired, not spoon-fed dusty old equations that have been proved a thousand times.  They want to explore.
"Eloi"?
I am the oldest.
We don't know.
They're inside --
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
Who are you?
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
How?
Do I know you from somewhere?
What should they be looking for?
Sure.
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
I think I can remember what's on them.
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
What?
I don't believe a thing she just said.
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
I could try to...make it stop.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
It doesn't look all that different.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
You know how to get there?
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
What?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
Hey.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
That sounds nice.
Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in the world are you doin' here?
I always knew that.
What the fuck is going on?
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
You're in Oklahoma?!
Louise, let me call you back after I wire it, so you'll know which office to go to.
Is that how you answer the phone?
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
It's nothin' like that.
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
Why now, Jimmy?
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?
You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be there around two or three.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
Taking a shower.
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
Drive!  Drive away!
I want you to call Darryl.
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
It won't work.
Yeah.
Before.
What little dogs?
What?!  What about him?!
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
I am really sorry about this.
Sorry!
I said all that?
Thelma, that is not an option.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
We've gone insane.
What?!  What d'you think?!
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
Hi!
Yeah... sure did.
What?
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
You sent that?
Yeah, right.
Well... at least now you know.
Mary's a babe!
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.
I don't know what to say.
Got cash.
Mary.
We're in love with your roommate.
Stalker, huh?
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
You own a home there?
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Fine. Fine.
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
Urrggghh...
Uh-huh.
You want her dead, don't you?
So she's married?
Huh?
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
You bet.
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
How many is that?
Four.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
It means you're too hard on guys.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
Holy shit...
Pat's an architect, too.
Can I pour you one?
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
Oh yeah. Fine.
And did everything -- ?
Well... why don't you move back?
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
Get out.
Go!
But but what about Steve?
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
What do you mean?
Oh God.
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
Hey.
See you, Warren.
Starshells.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
Tomorrow...
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
We were just debating who had it worse, us or George Washington and his guys.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
Yes it is.
This is from the Highest Authority?
John. How much time?
We are not at war, sir, not until we're at DEFCON 1.
It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
What about you? Where are you going?
No you weren't.
No choice. This is going to cost lives any way we go. Do nothing, and it could be 80 million of ours. We have to get rid of those missiles.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
I'm not calling and canceling on Daly. You call and cancel on Daly.
You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support.
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
-- did you understand me when I said that --
What the hell you doing?!
Jesus...
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
No. That's Ray here. Ray...
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
Go ahead.
She took something from the house. What she called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy's.
Her oil pan is shot.
When did we get that?
Bastards...
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
Why?
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
He knows me?
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
That's not solid.
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
This Clear Moon's house?
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
Come back?
At Sioux Falls Pen?
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
No.
There you go with those moves again.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
What are you talking about?
Why'd you do that?
It's not suffering anymore.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
Are you really that brave?
It's just as I thought.
What?
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
Hardly ever.
Strip reality! How do you play that?
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
Who's gonna win?
I live here, remember?
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
What is he doing?
What is?
You're crazy. We're level.
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
Bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. Take him. Pull on the goddamn stick, man!
BREAK LEFT! BREAK LEFT!   CHAFF! FLARES!
No! Not again!
Is it the plane?
Did what?
That's not what I heard.
Great move. Great
We did it!
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
Need a hint?
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
Who's the hell is that?
You didn't help.
Yes sir..
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
No bother.
I never heard that.
Welcome to Mars.
The Last Resort.
Tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
Fuck you.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
Hetero.
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?
Any news of Quaid?
You're Kuato, right?
Why not?
What trip?
You went to Rekall, remember?
I did?
What are you, my father?
Where?
Would you please repeat the destination?
Mmmm.....
Nobody?!  What's her name?
...You mean it?
I don't know!  It had something to do with Mars.
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
It was implanted by the Agency.
I'm honored.
I'm not interested in that.
Secret agent...How much is that?
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
She wasn't really my wife.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Where are you going?!
What reactor?!
Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck.  She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
You know, up the jeep trail.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
You're hung up again.
Pham Van don't get his mitts on <u>this</u> for no measly fifteen bucks!
Prairie dog burrow...
You go north, I'll go south.
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
Wait a minute...the Cat.  Could we take the Cat?
Like hell you are.
So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
What the hell are you doing?!!
Hi, I'm Rhonda.  Rhonda LeBeck. I'm up here for the semester...
And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
It was silver, with a stubby barrel... snub-nosed, I think they call it... It wasn't automatic, it had one of those... cylinders...
How can you remember that?
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
1530 Rivington Street.
But what?
-- Eddie...
I'm not that desperate.
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
You do.
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
Exactly what happened then?
But why would a guy would do that? Paint black teardrops on his face?
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
This and that.
We just discovered him, your Honor! His appearance is critical to a fair presentation of our case! He is an inmate at Ossining Correctional and --
Did you do any hands-on work or did you just supervise, from on high?
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
I followed you here from court.
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
Yeah, we do some of that.
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
Yes. Either right now or right when I thought of it. The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me. Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. Because it is only a feeling, I am powerless to stop it. And another thing, Albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
She's in high school. She's sexually active. She's on drugs. She's crying out for some help.
I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
Don't get funny with me again.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
I am going over here.
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
No one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
Where is the ring?
Lil was wearing a sour face.
Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
Yes, it is good.  What do you think is in these other drawers?
Geez, Agent Desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. Where are we going to sleep?
Are you speaking to me in a code?
You better dust this place, Sam.
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
James called me last night looking for you.
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
Maybe.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Where are the Cookies?
No.  I don't need to take this to be your friend.
No.
How did the car get back here?
I can't help you there.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
You missed somethin', Ed.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Who would do that?
No... No...
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
Hiking?
That would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since Andrew died.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
I understand.
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
Good night, Mom.
...school's fine...
No.
Dad?
Leland, what are you doing?
Leland...
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
You're right. There's no one here.
Come back as soon as you can.
I'm fine.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that. Isn't that right?
And wasn't that an oath...? These are your initials here: K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath. No less important than that which you took today.  Isn't that right?  Isn't that right...?
...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor. Certified in Internal Medicine?
No.
Through, through his book.
I did.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Objection!
Yes.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
I am on the staff of...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
...and you're going to do that?
I understand.
Hi.
Mrs. Simmonds.
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
What?
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.
Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
And it's over...?
I...
Who told you that?
Joe...  Joe...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
How come you're calling me from...?
Pardon?
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
I have to talk to you.
Are you out of your mind...?
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
Right.
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
What did she do?
I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said...
Yes, that's correct.
...of the procedures...
Yes, the roving nurse...
We, we were rather busy...
Yes.
Huh. And why is that?
Should I?
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
I've been as close to them as anyone. But not close enough for real observation...
It's about that meteor.  They say it's a whopper.  The District Officer phoned us at the lookout up on the summit. Thought you might be interested... It's ten or twelve miles from here - over by Linda Rosa.
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
D.O. to number three..come in.
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
One of mom's cups got broken.
No, you don't.
Like what?
Like Freddy.
No.
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
no.
He's on his way.
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
And...what's the man doing?
Freddy, for all I know.
Heather Langenkamp?
This is still a script we're talking about, right?
Heather, it's just a movie, a dream, really...
No time like the present.  The car will bring you.
Coffee'd be nice.
You sound so sure.
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
Why did we begin this?
What are they doing?
How old are you, son?
Gieg, Chuck.
She isn't that old.
What do you mean?
Believe what?
I couldn't have done it without you.
That's not why he's sending me.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
What the hell is going on?
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
What'd you do?
Ah... Northeast... sir.
Well, spit it out.
Sir...?
The Dolphin was a symptom.
They have every right Chuck.
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
What?!  What's happening?!!
How would you know?
What?  Come on...
Why, man?
Tie it off!!
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
About yourself?
What's it going to be?
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
What's Cao Ben?
How old are you?
I'm from all over.
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
What's that?
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
Gas?
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
That is my permiso.
The Good Witch...
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
Hey baby...
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
And you never told nobody about it?
Here she goes again...
You okay, honey?
That don't seem fair.
Yeah?
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Got anyplace special in mind?
What's that, peanut?
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
You certain?
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
Oh shit...
Oh God, Sailor.
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
Now what?
A little, I think... Darlin'?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
It's okay by me, peanut.
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
I mean tomorrow.
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
How can you say that, Sailor?
...live in exchange for sexual favors. Police said they have identified and questioned at least four girls, all Asians twelve to fifteen years old, who have been living in the North Houston warehouse with a Vietnamese pimp since February. The girls are being treated as victims, said police Sergeant Amos Milburn. 'These are really just children,' he said, 'but they've been exposed to a lot already.
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
Oh God! What does that mean?
Santos... It isn't.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
Santos...
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Yes.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
So?
You really are one dumb asshole.
Well?...
He's fine. He's narrating.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
Thank you.
Your wife.
Do you know how many times I've boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? Particularly while I'm on my way to Pittsburgh.
She left me. Crabs.
Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
Honestly, Tripp. Do you actually think I would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
Oh, Christ, don't start on ol' Gran or we'll leave you here.
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
Shut up, James.
Who do you think it is?
The hood jumper?
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
In a sense.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
I know.
Bullshit. I know a gun when I see one. And that's a gun.
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
Well...
A little.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
Whose tuba is that anyway?
Can I ask you something about her?
This is so embarrassing! You guys had to carry me out.
Shit. He must've left it back at Thaw. In the auditorium.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
What kind of dancer?
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Kinship. And what's here?
Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
So, why did you take me up there?
Because of my coat?
You're lying.
The hell I am.
I never said that.
I didn't mean it that way.
Yes, Hannah?
I think so... What about you?
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
All right. This morning --
Emily left me this morning.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
No, really, Sara, I don't think you --
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
You heard? How?
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Really? That was fast.
Sara.
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
You don't deserve me, you know.
The more the merrier.
Listen, Antonia --
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
Oh?
What is it, Grady?
Excuse me?
Do you get high, Sam?
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
A jockey? You mean, like --
No, the dog.
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
You doing okay?
When can I see her?
What party?
You're a good man, Walter. Okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you're a good, decent man.
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
You don't have to tell me this.
What are you looking at?
Birds.
Why not?
You always carry these?
Something like that.
That was terrific.
My daddy likes me home before dark.
I'm not pretty.
Hiya, Walter.
I haven't broken any laws.
I would.
Too much sun.
Do you believe in them?
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
What?
Do you have many friends?
No.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
Would you like to sit on my lap?
And how's your job?
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
Why do you think you're here?
Do you know what "normal" is?
I don't.
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
What did you want to happen?
I don't see --
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
How old are you and your sister?
This is garbage!
What else?
I was six years old!
It's going to take time, Walter.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
Why do you want to know?
The morning?
What for?
What's the worst thing you ever did?
Molested little girls?
I never hurt them. Never.
Nothing. It's over.
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
Not ever?
What?
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
How you guys doing?
You got it?!  You got it?
Where are we?
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
You wimp.  I had a lot riding on this.  They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
No.
What do you think he saw?
You dumb jarhead motherf--
He's got the shakes?
He's jammed the mechanism.
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
We've only got one suit.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Virgil?
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Is that it?  Is this right?
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
What's you depth, Cab Three?
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
I'd like to find a place where I can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. I'd like to try...
How are you?
Sandro... A month is too long a time. I have become used to being without you.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
At what?
Have you decided?
Really! Still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. What was her purpose in that?
Find anything?
And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
And why did you drop them?
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
Yes, she started to but I didn't feel like staying to listen to what she had to say. If we had to listen to everybody...
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
Why?
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
Who are you talking to?
What do you think?
And what are we going to do now?
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
What other boat?
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
And what did they say about me?
Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.
But where did you come from?
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
You're kidding!
About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES  I've been commanded by God.
Yes.
Who?
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
It's a sin to be fat.
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
Why?
What do you mean?
Oh, there are so many.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Oh, I know he does.
He's told you?
Oh, yes.
Something I ate.
I went to my room.
And what happened?
Where did the baby come from?
The baby they made up.
What do you mean?
What's your real name?
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
Who?
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
I was a mistake.
Agnes...
Answer me!  You never answer me.
Sometimes, yes.
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
She can't hurt you any more.
She watches... she listens.
She...
Are you pretty?
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
Yes.
I'm frightened.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
What else?
Who?
No...
I hate him...
Who?
It was alive wasn't it?
???
What?
Why?
Marty, what are you doing here?
Larry...
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
When?
No, no, no...
No!
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
What's his name?
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
That's ridiculous...
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
Who?
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
???  
Then help her.
When was that?
About what?
Your niece!
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
All right?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Mary Magdelen?
Become?  One is born a saint.
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
Somebody told her.
Was it you?
Yes.
For what?  An abortion?
She can't remember.
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
Lay them down.
Yeah, I've blown school out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah, you know, "O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"
Ever seen one of these before?
We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
Of course I can.
I'll have a bash.
It is, y'know.
A butcher?
Gerron.
Did you look in here?
Oh!
How'd you guess?
Are you pulling my leg?
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
But that's not like a real person at all.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
And what's it all come to in the end?
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
Hello, Grandfather!
Come on let's get this coffee.
You see.  You know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
No, that's his other one.
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
Ah, go on, you swine.
It's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.
Now get on with it.
Don't cane me, sir, I was led astray.
The office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.
Now, look here, Norm ...
Is it?
I would have said so.
Aye, but you know him well.
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.
"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr. Richard Starkey, that's you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet." Blimey!
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
Hell, we're equipped --
Yeah.  Two hours.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
Don't you remember?
I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Well, get started.
Why, what's wrong?
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
You like this shit?
You know what they make this stuff out of?
We could cut a section out of that metallite netting.  It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.
Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
It makes me sick to see him like that.
You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
How's Broussard?
He's running a fever.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
Good!  That's good!
We're not going anywhere.
I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
What's happening up here?
We can use the flamethrower.
Just settle down.  Sandy, you get any response yet?
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
There, it caught!
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
What the hell happened?
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Not a one.  It's dead.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
It started crashing around right after we locked it in.
Now what?
Which presumably means...
I saw it.  Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door.  His body held it open.
Better?
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
What do you need?
What's happening?
Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
One of 'em must have escaped.
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
What's wrong?
Nobody wander off on their own until it's found.  Keep in pairs. Diller, once the first team's done their sweep I want you to go down with Annie to Three-Pump while she replaces it.
Is this the suit?
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
Fort Powell.  What do we tell 'em?
Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
I'm serious.  That's why I switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Six month stint on Datus.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
And what is your name?
Phoebe?
You're more than modest.
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
What a day - what a heavenly day...
Paved with what, then?
What time?
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
A dull cliche.
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
She was a liar, she was a liar!
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
I don't think I'm going.
I'm tired. I want to go home.
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
Hi.  My wonderful junk yard. The mystery and dreams you find in a junk yard-
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
I'll try.
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
And cut that out right now.
Knit me a muffler.
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
So she seems.
- guilty.
Thank you.
It's all over.
What fire and music?
The kid. Junior.
No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
I've been aware of that for some time.
I'll say.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
I wish it were.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
A cowboy.
I just wondered.
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
Well?
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
An answer.
She works hard.
How did you get in here?
Not at all.
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
Not just that way. As a friend...
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
Eve... don't cry.
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
- an understudy's performance.
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
It doesn't matter.
What about Bill?
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
Eve.
I'm trying hard to follow you.
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
Now just a minute-
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
Who is it? What's it all about?
I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
How's the new one coming?
The play? All right, I guess...
How do you mean?
Margo, you haven't got any age.
She was a revelation...
That depends.
I mean really, deeply angry...
I don't think I could be.
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
I just played it.
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
You get quick action, don't you?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
Are you breaking the contract?
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
All right, what do we know?
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
Goddamnit--
We understand your problem--
When?
'68.
You want me to be the bastard.
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
--for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
How high up, which Republicans?
Woodward?
What does it say?
--jeeeeeeeeesus--
Night.
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
The telephone calls... we know about that.
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
Do you feel much about the things you did?
Tell that to Muskie.
--that was awhile ago--
Where are your bills, Carl?
I think.
--you don't really think you're being followed?
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
So tell me about the Times article.
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
What's this?
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
Why didn't they?--who told them not to?
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
As usual, that keen mind of yours has pegged the situation perfectly.  Except  it wasn't local Democratic Headquarters, it was National Democratic Headquarters--  --and  these weren't just any idiots, these were special idiots, seeing as when they were arrested at 2:30 this morning, they were all wearing business suits and Playtex gloves and were carrying--  --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized tear gas guns, plus various bugging devices.  Not to mention over two thousand dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred dollar bills.
What'd you get on W.House?
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
--listen, I love this country, you think I want to bring it down?--I'm not some goddamn zany, I was a hawk--
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
Haldeman.  Right?
The what to what?
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
Charming.
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.
You can call me Oz.
You can call me Ostreicher.
That's nice.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
Yeah right.
That's not why we're going out.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
You got it, stud.
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
I don't get it, that really works?
That's what we are, we keep each other on track.  Prior to this day, we've postured.  We've procrastinated. We've pretended.  We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
Did I miss anything?!
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Yes dad.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Dad.
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
There it is.  I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
After getting laid?
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
Oh...ungghhhhh!
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
See -- this is the nicest room.
Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
That was a great night.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
Kevin, it was just a --
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
Bullshit.  From where?
<u>Yeah</u>!
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.
Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
Look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
Also like sex with my wife.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
Thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
What?
What about your glasses?
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
What makes you so sure this will work?
I hope they fucking fry us all.
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Nothing's happening!
What about me?
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Shit. I feel sick.
Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
Andy, stop! I think he can help you - 
Andy!
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
Here.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
I have to go now, before it gets light.
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
No! I look ridiculous!
What happened to your parents?
By pulling my hair?!
What a beautiful ship!
I'm sorry.
Oh! I'm sorry...
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
Dmitri?
Don't let me go!
Bartok... a question.
Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
But it's not	the money, Vlad.
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
Promise me she'll have her home.
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Hey, you on television?
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
Singer!
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
You're a thinking person. How can you choose this lifestyle?
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
Who are you?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
We've been through this.
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas.  Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
Stop it, Alvy!
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what...  Am I your first big romance?
He was creepy.
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Oh, no, I have a car.
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Okay.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Oh, yeah.
Neat?
Uh, narcolepsy.
Oh, thank you.
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
No, so help me.
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
Yeah.
M'hm.
Look at these guys.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
Who cares? Who cares?
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
Oooh.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Oh. What?
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
It's for my complexion.
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
I don't know.
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
Oh-
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
I'm late.
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
I tell you this because, as an artist, I think you'll understand. Sometimes when I'm driving... on the road at night... I see two headlights coming toward me. Fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly, head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion.  The sound of shattering glass. The... flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.
What'd I do?
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Don't get upset!
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
I can't.
My head is throbbing.
Yes.
Just give me the license, please.
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Yeah, watch the road!
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Well, sit down.
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
But she's colored.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
You think so? Do you really?
Well, hi!
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Yeah.
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Why didn't you come in?
Jack.  Did you compose that yourself?
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
Who, Sally?
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
I have a small window of time.
She already has.
Not this time.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
I don't know how to make her funny.
I'd say it was down.
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
Pictures.  They're always in my tote.  I left my tote in the damn trailer.  But! He's Mac all over again.  Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
It's not a contest.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
Just did.  Jealous?
The suspense is killing me.
And?
You need to call your dad.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
We've heard lots about you.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
It was fifteen seconds.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
We closed.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
Kiss the back of my knees.
No.  I missed that.
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
Well, not yet.  The gate was open?
Otis!!!!
Otis!
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
It's a novel.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
You changed your mind.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
I don't want to go tonight.
I know.
Has she called?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
It's a novel.
Don't I find what?
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
You're an interior decorator, right?
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
Very well put.
Elitism?
Are you okay?
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
What?
There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need...
Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
Thank you.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Suicidal.  It's much less codependent.
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
How?
It's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  It's one of your parties.
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
No.  Not something new.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
Thank you, Panes.
Panes?
Yes.
I didn't know you had this.
And here they are!
He's a novelist.
And the food sucks, I know.
You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally.  It's only five months since Joe came back.
Not nice.  Not kind.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Tell me about it.
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
Really?
And you are...?
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
Well I guess that makes us even.
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
Want a list?
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Hlllllllp!
Z...if we don't make it...I just want you to know....
Come on, Z.
What do we have on this "Insectopia"?
So...you two are in love?
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
I do not recollect, your majesty. Will that be all?
I feel...isolated.  Different.  I've got abandonment issues.  My father flew away when I was just a larva. My mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  I feel physically inadequate -- I've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  Sometimes I think I'm just not cut out to be a worker.  But I don't have any other options.  I was assigned to trade school when I was just a <u>grub</u>.  The whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
My mother.
This the place?
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
Would you like to?
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
What time does the show go on?
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
How come?
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
I don't understand --
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
Baxter.
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
You really think so?
No doubt about it.
I don't like myself very much anyway.
You sure you want to throw that card?
Sure.
Are you supposed to?
In this house, you're supposed to.
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
I guess so.
A what?
You did?
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
I guess so.
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
Baxter?
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
Not that I have anything to hide.
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
So it was.  She threw it at me.
Now what was your news, Baxter?
You like?  It's all yours.
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
Yes, sir.
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
What do you mean, sorry?
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
Now you're being bright?
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
Baxter?
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
Make it thirty minutes.  What do you say, Bud?
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
Dear Mr. MacIntosh --  Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute.  All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far.  Now what is it, Baxter?
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Good evening, Baxter.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
Want to tell me what happened?
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
How do you spell her last name?
Kubelik -- with two k's.
Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?
It's regulations.
Sure, Doc.
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
Who is Mickey?
No.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
We talked about a lot of things.
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
It's a thought.
Yeah.
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
I said I like all of them.
Who the hell are you?
Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
Part.
None.
I was an FO for the 25th.
Fat. That's real fat.
We do.
How long were you up there ?
What do you see?
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
You forgot the mangoes, didn't you?
Who knows what's up there?
Well, get in there.
What the hell is it?
Touchy.
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?
But why ?
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
Thank you, sir.
I haven't surfed since I got here.
They far enough?
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
What'd you do for supplies?
Don't you agree?
We'll come in low out of the rising sun -- We'll put on the music about a mile out.
You were not coming here, to see me?
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
You've gone crazy.
I can handle it.
How did we get here?
What are you doing?
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
Both of us...
You hear it again?
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
What's this tiger shit?
You think?
You must realize, Captain -- we have lost much here -- I, my husband. Gaston -- his wife and son.
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
What things?
What show ?
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
23   CONTINUED:
Let's go.
119  CONTINUED:  
How did she..?
-- Get this straight: I'm the District Supervisor.  Whatever you do reflects on me.  It wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but I'm stuck with you. You are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. Whichever side you take, you alienate the other.  Mr. Corbett is quite well-known in this region.  People admire him --
What happened here?
Sam?  We haven't seen him.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
He's coming around fine.
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
You make it sound like a prison sentence.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
Sounds like professional jealousy.
Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
Nome?  I figure you'd be a whaler, coming from there.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
You wouldn't shoot anyone...
Sam, listen -- I shot to defend my man.  Other guy drew first.
Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
Fuck you.
Hey, Sam, look over there.  Black and white smoke.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
...Ben never sent a signal.
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
You're not still writing that thank-you note?
Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
No.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
Sorry.
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
Okay.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Thanks, Melvin.
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
You don't owe me that.
This one has a special meaning.
The two might go together.
Okay to say something now?
What do you want?
Grouchy?
Boyfriend?
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
Was this supposed to be your room?
No!!!
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
What are you trying to do to me?
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
Is he dead yet?
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Absolutely not.
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
What are you doing?
Yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
Tachlinkov.
We go around once.
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
What?
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
You want me to pump?
Nikita?
What does that mean?
Forget it!
Why?
Why?
Yes.  As soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  That's all there is.  Until then, there is nothing.  You are nothing.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
Are they usually like that?
You said you didn't trust it.
Do you think about the game?
No.
Really?
It's too late now.  Okay?  We'll have to deal with these.
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
You didn't take it.
No.
They're worth less points.
I didn't notice them.
Jesus, if someone had --
Nobody ever sees me.
No.
And you were drilling these holes...?
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Did he explain how this happened?
Because, I'll take it.
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
Uh-huh.
That doesn't sound normal.
God damnit, Electra.  This is not a game.  This is business.
I prefer it like this.
Sometimes.
Why not?
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
Taken.
Anything.
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
So how's your work?
I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
How to make a buck!
Because it's in English?
Sorry Katka, but I'm with Doug on this.
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
What's that? Free!
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
He was an electrician?
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Yep, except a name for this place.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
'cause you stink of booze.
No....The Asylum!
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
Close!
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
No, not yet.
What happened to Katka?
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
So?
Did you see anything in the files?
Yeah, no problem.
Yeah, pretty well.
Good morning.
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
They didn't look like medical files to me.
We should be done by the weekend.
You used to read.
I'm not going in Doug. I'll wait for you here.
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
So, we won't be going to London?
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
No way Doug, I can't.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
There's nothing there for me.
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
Okay?
Ah, so what?
What for?
Is it dry?
Don't you have a girlfriend?
Uh-huh!
Why don't we both forget about him?
This is your doing?
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
Would you like your things now?
We had a deal!
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Will you come home and forget all about him?
Yes, if you can get him free.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
And what of these foreigners?
And I have no idea why.
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
A late night or an early morning?
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
-- This your idea of small talk?
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
-- This play means a lot to me.
What the -- ?!
No problem --
The world of the dead?
What is that?
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
The dirty snowball at its core.
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
You were great the other night.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
Like fire.
It's only 7:30.
You're sometimes not sure?
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
Ergo?
I should have told you sooner --
I'll talk to your father.
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.
No.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
For Jefferson High. For books.
Where did you get -- ?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
I've been calling you for five minutes! Didn't you hear me?
You mean you're going to stay up all night?
Here's your jacket!
Hi, Marty.
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Eileen, Chinese food again?
Well... yeah...
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
I don't want to hit you in the stomach!
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
I'm going to be at the dance.
You mean, you're gonna --
Who, me?
What?
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
AM or PM?
No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
Marty.
You didn't, Professor. It was an accident! You see, what happened --
Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
Uh, yeah... Gimme a Tab.
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
Yeah.
What do you feed him?
You ever held another job before?
Well, Kit...
Is that right?
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
Yeah? Why not?
Okay.
Doing what?
You're a redhead.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
I can look and see.
Why?
How's he doing?
I don't want a steak.
I'd like to get out of here.
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Hi... ah, Mister Scarborough here?
Yes?
This your place?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Just gimme a chance.
Smells fermented.  Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
What?
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
You okay?
Arachtoid.
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
Raise your hand...where?
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
She was killed, Penny.
Oh, my.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Hello.
Well I have to come up with – an outline, I'd guess you call it. The story. The whole goddamn story. Soup to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-
Before what?
I write.
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
...Huh? No, I'm –
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
I don't understand-
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
Sound a little what?
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Well, I don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  Who cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop and Lady Higginbottom and – and – and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?
Exactly, Charlie! You understand what I'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. Because you're a real man!
Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
I hope these are your shoes.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
...Your room does that too?
No... Can I come in?
...Will you stay with me till they get here?
Yeah.
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
Mr. Lipnik.
Yes sir.
Tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
Yes, Colonel.
Home. Watching TV.
Yeah.
Yeah, I was drinking.
I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
No?
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
Catherine Tramell.
I need a cigarette.
What did she tell me, Beth?
I had him in two classes.
Yes.
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
I don't smoke.
Because you didn't love him --
Sure.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
I didn't.
Don't get too cocky.
What's it about?
Fine.  How's your back?
About three months before I met you.
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
I found Lisa Henderson.
No.
What are you researching?
Why?
I finished my book.
You workin' on another book?
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.
Nope, can't say that I do.
He had a girlfriend?
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
I never heard of him.
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
What are you doing here, Pop?
It doesn't make sense.  She didn't know me three months ago.
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
I'm going with you.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
You knew her, didn't you?
How old was she when this happened?
Did you check all four years?
Hey – it's the big A.M..
When's your show?
Why, so you could humiliate me?
Naa..
Do you ever get sick of it?
The whole thing – painting.
Ouch..
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
Is Jean Michel here?
No.
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
How do you know?
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
I use a lot of colors – not only black.
You're not?
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Out?
You got a date already?
Check you later, man.
You gonna carry that around all night?
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
I guess it was a long time ago.
Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
Guess I just got sick of him.
What's that?
Don't you think he's using you?
Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.
It's three thousand dollars!
That's great.
I didn't know.
Sorry, Alfred, I have to get to the Plaza.  You heard Penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
I guess this mean we won.
Don't be naive.  The law doesn't apply to people like him!  Or us --
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
You almost sound enthusiastic.
"We"?  You and...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
Y'mean take off our costumes?
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
You buy this "blurry" business?
I could teach her my "French flipper" trick...
Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
What is it?
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.  Batman monopolized the evening news.
Specify, please.
Oxbridge Academy?
Keep it.
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Alpha.  Got it.  What the hell is attack plan Alpha?
Crimefighter's rule number two.
What exactly are you doing?
It'll take the satellites about a minute to re-align, but...damn!
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
You think Freeze will take the bait?
You don't have two million.  Three million - -
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
Can he save her?
No beauty...
If we could relay the sunlight-
Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
Wild doesn't exactly cover it.
That's gotta hurt.
He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
But he's never said a word-
Like hell you do.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
She wants to kill you.
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
As a team, the duncely duo protect each other.  But the Robin is young. Impetuous.  If I could get him alone-
I'm glad you came.  I can't breathe without you.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
She has an excellent mind.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Why do I keep doing this?
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
Mystery.
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
My life's an open book. You read?
I haven't had much luck with women...
Mr...?
What? Oh, Edward. Hi. Congratulations. Great party-
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
It's a stretch but I'll manage.
That's usually my line.
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
What are you talking about?
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Can't tell if you don't say please.
Why be brutalized by an uncaring world? My RES Box will give Joe Q Public a realm where he is king.  Not that someone like you would need it. Someone so intelligent. Witty. Charming. But for the lonely, the...
Paranoid? The psychotic?
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
A hit.
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
Take me. Let the boy go.
I know. I called them.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
All street mimes should be executed.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
No one would miss me.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
We got 'em!
Boss! Jesus! They've --
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
I'm on top of it.  If there's a problem --
My brother's a priest, man.
That's it?
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
And you want a --
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
No.
Are they paying you for all this?
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
Go ahead.
Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
Ah, David.  Finally.  And this must be our professor from across the sea.
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
I'm fired?  Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
Of course.
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
You arrange those flowers yourself?
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
Is Jenny gonna be okay?
Yes?
Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
This sucks.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
We're gonna get paid to score.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
Me first!
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
Butt-dumpling...
Uh... butt-snatch...
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
Uh, we didn't score yet.
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Ah, the witness?
Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real pros here. My opinion, terrorists... What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
D.C., Chief.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I scored with both of them...
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
Yeah, I want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I'll help you.
I don't think we survived the crash.
Cabin fever, hon?
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
We'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  Barbara and I worked very hard on this house.
I feel really stupid.
Where are your skulls and bones?
Here's something.
Three times.  Powerful number.
I guess we open it.
N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
Little black party dresses?
3:30 I guess.
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
<u>Don't say his name</u>!  Just practice. Do it <u>yourself</u>!
We're...
Just one daughter.
Look at me, think of me as cash! This offer is really real!  From a rich man in New York City who only saw a photograph!
Yeah.
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
I don't know what that signal means.
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit battle? Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
Just <u>say</u> it.
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
... I will.
It's <u>Otho</u>!
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
What do you think, honey?
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
The attic room is locked --
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
It does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
Look at that <u>detail</u>!
Are they still here, Otho?
Yes. I think so, too.
Yes.
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
No sir, I don't believe I do.
I hope you're comfortable.
I agree.
No. It won't do that.
Good. I'm glad to hear that.  ... How did you like meeting the President?
Yes. I was.
Oh, I like that very much.
No, thank you.
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
I like to watch.
Yes. I like to watch.
No. I'm not busy.
I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
I don't want Robert.
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Yes. I like that name very much.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
I see.
Mr. Gardiner, how very nice to have you with us this evening.
I always find it surprising, Mr. Gardiner, to find men like yourself, who are working so intimately with the President, yet manage to remain relatively unknown.
Yes.
Yes. It's very cold outside today, isn't it, Thomas?
... How long have you been living here?
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
Well, Mr. Gardiner, that's just fine with me - I'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... Be seated, please, Mr. Gardiner...
Try again.
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
Thank you, Greta.  I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
... What do you make of all this?
Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
Clearly, yes comrade.
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
So...? Where the hell is it?
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
Good. Anything else?
The one where you're that jewel thief.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
What?
Why'd you do it, Craig?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Hmmm.
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
The iguana.
Yeah. You want a beer?
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
I have to go back now.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
What are you doing?
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
You came up here looking for the portal?
I know.
Maxine...
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
Pardon?
Schwartz.
Money, Miss Warts?
Mr. Juarez?
I said "yes."
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
The usual, Barry.
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
I've fallen in love.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Can I be anyone I want?
Two hundred dollars, please.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Lotte called me.
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
No one would ever have to know its not him.
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
Then what do I do?
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
Was a time I knew what was.
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
Beloved..She's mine       I am Beloved
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
YES.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
Baby, don't be like that.
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
I want somethin' sweet.
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Yes ma'am..
You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
I miss her.
But mama..
Out where?
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
I know Denver.
That's so.
Just me.
You don't know what I think.
Sethe?
Yeah. Look bad?
Hiya Allan.
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Shit.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
Hey, man, I'm not--
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!
NUSSING!
Yeah.
What's this?
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
If what's during league play?
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
Are these.
No, they--
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
Yes, heh--
In the briefcase?
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Is that what that's a picture of?
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
Well--sure, I could do that--
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Delayed after-eff--
What happened to your house?
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
No, but--
Theodore Herzel.
Hey Walter--
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.
No, you're not wrong--
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
What the fuck is going on there?
What'd he say?  Where's the hand- off?
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Uh-huh.
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already spent all the money!
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
Dude?
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
Uh-huh.
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking asshole!
Dude, I'm sorry--
Yeah?
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds. This will not stand, ya know, this will not stand, man.  I mean, if your wife owes--
It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
I don't know, sir.
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy wife, I mean, in the parlance of our times, owes money all over town, including to known pornographers-- and that's cool, that's cool-- but I'm saying, she needs money, and of course they're gonna say they didn't get it 'cause she wants more, man, she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean-- hasn't that ever occurred to you...? Sir?
Brandt, give him the envelope.
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
Shit, sorry man.
Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
Bullshit. Walter!
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
Where to first?
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
Each day is a little life.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
I don't like it.
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
Put it back in park, Blade.
And why is that?
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
Get in. You’re leaving.
It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
But I just got here --
You used me as bait?!
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
I can't -- I won't be able to stop --
Then what is it?
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
So that's it? You guys just patch me up and send me on my way?
Try, please, Anna--
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
No.
Bullshit! Talk!
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
No.
--do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
What?
--now c'mon!
Are you marked like this??
Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
So, I hear you're from New Mexico!
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
I don't know yet.
Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
Does it hurt?
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
I don't believe this.
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
We should be so lucky.
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Fire escape??
Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
Fucking owl!
Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
Why?
You planning on sleeping out there?
Ripped? They look like they were <u>bit</u> off.
At least go drink it somewhere spilling it won't drive him to suicide.
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
Still working on it.
Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking <u>go</u>-- she won't leave this place.
--a <u>lot</u>.
Heather.
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
Who <u>is</u> this??
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
What was that?
What?
On the phone. Was it for you?
Well... the couch would be all right...
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
...Huh?
Ray?... What time is it?
...You all right?
What do you want to know?
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
What did you take these for?
...There's a big--
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
Dead, huh?
What's this?
You said the usual--
What's the point?
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
Tuesday.
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Anything you can tell me?
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Who knows you have these?
Shut up. It's daddy. shithead.
Who's this fuck?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Those are my breasts.
Frank. he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. come on. He didn't mean it.
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
See my nipples?
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
I liked being with you last night.
Don?. Are you in with them?
Yes.
I sure don't hate you.
Yes.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
I asked first.
Shhhhhh. Now I have your disease.
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Dorothy. no!
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
Yeah, it's me.
Don?. Where is he?
I don't want to go.
Hey? . You like to walk.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Yes.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Alright.
You didn't goof it up, but. you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday. do you have a date tonight?
You really want to do this, don't you?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
I'm sorry, I didn't.
Okay. okay.
Shoot.
Jeffrey?. Why?
Everything okay?
You didn't tell him about me?
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
It's good to see you.
It's okay.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Let's wait for some slow one.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
uh uh.
What?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Well.
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Would you like a piece of cake?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Blanca, por favor.
Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
Tuna, this is crap.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
Excuse me?
Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
Goodness.
What did I tell you?
You?
Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a cheeseburger or something.  What does she weight, eighty pounds?
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
I never believed you were a murderer.  I knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
Good night.
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
Oh my G-d.
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
Four passenger, single engine Cessna.
I just got released five minutes ago.
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Who's the cheapskate?
It would be my pleasure.
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Dad.
Tell Mom, you know...
She did that before.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
I said, I've seen it before.
Where are you going?
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
What do you want?
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
How are you doing?
Dad.
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
Yeah.
Where are you going?
There's schools in California.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Because she's visiting me.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
This is bullshit, George.  We're never going to find anything down there.
And you believe the NLF?
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
With an unloaded pistol?
Sure. By shooting at me.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
Can you read?
Where's Kader?
To show them to the UN, right?
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Why?
How can I give you this statement?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?
Take some time off.
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
Then how did it get into his body?
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
I'm talking to you as a friend now. Don't ruin your life, your career for her.  She'll spit you out when this is over.
Why did you come by?
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
She didn't.  She just left.
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Did you ever see her again after that?
Yes.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
What did you prescribe for her?
I heard him say it.
I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
We dated for about a month last year.
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Yes.
Frank!
Yes.
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
Is it against the law?
Oh -- Well, they're different.
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
What would?
What?
Can I see you later?
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you to go with her.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
Yeah.
-- But it's Sunday.
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
Really.
Is that alright, Frank?
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
It was a place to start.
Albert's got the stomach flu.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
Yes.
Well, I can help.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
Well, what am I supposed to think?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
I never knew that.
Did we want to?
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
That's it.
No.
Are you from Washington originally?
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Where are you staying while you're here?
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
I feel so embarrassed.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Then what happened?
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
Francesca?
What?
What?
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
Am I interrupting anything?
Oh, sure. Great.
It's Robert.
Yes.
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
I bet you could do a book.
Why do you say that?
But you don't mind.
I can't do this, honey.
Am I too heavy for you?
Sleep all right?
Yes, thanks.
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
WHY?
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
Later. Go back to sleep.
Where you going?
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
Apparently just before her death.
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
Where's the gangsta of love?
But that's your old hood, Pops.
You got a nice crib here.
What else?  Money.
Sorry, my brother.
You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
It's alright, baby.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
What else does she say?
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
I can't.  Not yet.
Nice rack.  How old is --
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
You boys been hitting the pipe?
It was just like in my head.
Yeah, you heard of him?
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.
The same way you did before.
The next one blows off your dick.
No!
Jesus, Caesar!
What are you talking about?
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
Caesar, this is crazy.
Caesar ...
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
No I didn't.  Not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  Then they never showed up.
What happened to them?
Where is the money?
Don't tell him --
Stupid cunt!
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business.
We were in a car accident --
They were in a car accident.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
What?  They ain't there?
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
We was worried about you, Cease.
Hey, Caesar, where's the key?
You got the key?
You're doing everything yourself?
Truck.  Of course.
'63 Chevy.
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
Thanks.
Okay, one drink.
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
What about that guy this morning?
Even though he knew about you?
He was in love with you, right?
For what?
How much money?
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
And where is it now?
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Why?
Gino Marzzone.
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Yeah.
What did Gino drink?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
I'm just asking, what if?
There is no going back.
Not Caesar.
Why?
He'll have to run.
Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do.  I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
Done.  We go now.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
I don't know what we're talking about.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
Are you Treadstone?
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
You're a U.S. Citizen?
Yes, I'm...I'm looking for Mr. Jason Bourne.
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
Bonjour?  Monsieur?  Allo...
There was an accident.  On the motorway.  Apparently, he was killed instantly.  Really, I'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
Who?  Who came?
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Really.
I don't want to go alone.  I want you to drive me to Paris.  Like we're a couple.  Like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  That's all we're doing.
I won't hurt you.
I don't know.
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
I needed a break.
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just...
Okay, so...
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
Oh, Jesus...
Nykwana Wombosi. 
xxxxxx
What was I thinking, right?
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
My husband's out looking for him.
He run away often?
Get in the basement.
That's the only angle.
-- I'm on it --
-- he accessed the account --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
What the fuck is he doing?
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
-- call the code! -- I want everyone out! --
What if it doesn't come back?
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
You telephone, sir.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
Oh, yes. We've got everything here. Every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
It's reply paid.
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Her name is Jill.
Mr. HELPMANN, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the Ministry Of Information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
But the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
Gillian Layton?
Long time no see!
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
How much do you know?
Enough though, eh?
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
You got the wrong man.
But surely, I mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the Buttles, and ...
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
{baffled) I don't follow you.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Yes we have, Jack!
Help me, Jack! I'm frightened!
How do you think I feel? You shit!
Stamped?
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
What's going on here?
Oh God! What have we done?
What?
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
Are you still following me?
Leave me alone!
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Don't do anything silly.
Perhaps the machine's on the blink! It keeps picking up old films. That can't he right, can it?
Oh, good!
The refund for Tuttle!
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Can I forget it?
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
This is your dream girl, is it?
She didn't say anything about it to me.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
This isn't rare!
Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
It's too exciting. I've left Dr Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
Hello ... hello ...
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
Now look what you've done to him.
What is it?
Harry Tuttle. Heating engineer. At your service.
Are you expecting anyone?
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
No way, man.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
He's dead, huh?
Yes.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
That's how it's done. You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
He's better, though, right?
You married?
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
Fifteen minutes.
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose. Break out the Narcon.
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
Nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. There's a mystery to it, then she shows you.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
It's coming.  Hold her down.
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
Get this, Frank--we got two patients. Number one, the scarecrow outside. Number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he's now passed out.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Frank!
Oh no!--I just remembered.
What?
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
He's crazy.
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Wait.
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
No.  That's not going to tell us anything.  Let's get this prompter going.
You were smokin' toward the end there.
Everybody has one like that.  I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
They booted me out of Washington.
I don't think so.
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
Eleven and a half.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Watch? --
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
How'd it go?
Do you feel good about it?
I lost six pounds...
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
What?
Yeah -- being a basket case.
I think you're the Devil.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Yes.
Your hair's a little funny.
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice.  Okay.
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
I understand.  I'll go with you.
Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot... Fuckee.  You want to use that?
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
We could...
Play back the last line...
Bad manners.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
What?
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Jane -- For God's sake...  Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
If we could just eat first.
That actually goes on...
Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
I've got another story.
What?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Who?
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
Okay.  Good night.
Good night??!
Why?
It just proves that the difference we have are...
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
Are you nervous, Walter?
Alright we're clear.
What did he do?
May I please have another little kiss?
Thank you.
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
I'm trying to find a style of my own.  Do you really like them?
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
Why not?
I know, man.
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Man this is heavy!
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
H-have a seat?
Yeah, why?
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
You're gonna shoot me!
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
She doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Suck!
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
Invite me in, Pike.
Real 'quality-timers,' Hugh.
Come on, what was it?
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Well, stay here tonight.
You sure?
I know.
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
He did what he was supposed to.
That's me.
You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
Bugs.
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
Cramps?
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
Oh, him.
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
Put your head back.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
I wish you would.
I'm curious, is all.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Hi.
What's happening?  What do you want?
No --
Okay, let's go.
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
Buffy, the ape-woman.
What are you talking about?
Oh, thank you very much.
And the January Semi-formal --
Ah, you'll be coming back.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
No.
No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
I'll tuck you in.
That's my leg.
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
Well I guess this is it.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
Damn.
Crash...I want you.
Aren't we all?
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
Who?
I got released.
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
Yeah...you a witch?
Annie---
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
You need a nickname.
Which one of us?
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
Well, I held it like an egg.
He did know.
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
What?
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
I'm going to the Show.
Why am I a fuck?
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
Sorry about last night.
No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
No way.
Who you calling a "boy"?
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
Jim looking for somebody.
Where does he go?
Look at yours.
Liar.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
Was I at that dinner?
I'm serious. No interference.
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
Oh, good.
Yeah.
She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
Hello.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message.
He insulted Billy. And then I walked over to him politely...
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit. They got two names in there for the whole country and one of them is still Al Capone.
Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like?
Yeah, forget about your fuckin' license. I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' license.  You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy, but the more I talk to you, the more I feel like you just don't wanna go along with me, is that it?
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
That's right, yeah.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
I -
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
No, I'm not okay.
How'd you know I was here?
Yeah, she's here.
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
No problem.  Sorry.
Well, that's why they paid so well.
I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
Any change?
Okay, want to go with Mommy?
What do you need?
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
What's it...
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
Okay?
So, what'd ya do with it?
The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore.  Where's Amy?
Who were you with?
...she did what she did and I did what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could've done.
What if he won't stop?
I mean, it could get us both killed.
Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.  Listen, you fuckin' cunt.
Oh, sh-
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
You want your jewelry?
Just wait there for me!
I am not!
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
...Well, I've got a large family.
Loose machines are right back over there.
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
A record of the arrests...
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
Can't do it with both hands?
No, Sir.
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
Mm.
I don't want to go to Europe.
You know where she gets this from!
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.
Yeah, that works out.
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
Can I go in?
Come on. I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
He's not here?
What?
Hey, Frankie.
I'll take care of it, Remo.
Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
And I mean... that's no good.
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Hi, how are you?
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
What? What?
Let me think about that.
Sure did.
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
...same outfit.
What's the matter?
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Get lost?
I'm always here for you.
Here.
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
Listen...
There's more!
Incredible.
Two.
Yeah.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
Hey. This is Shelly.
And this is Stacy.
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
Denying?
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
I know it, I know it.
He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
In women?
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
Are you sure?
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
You're kidding.
I've been looking for you.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Pass!
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
You're not a super-hero. You're not even a hero. You're a scary, sick, fake who made a big mistake. You killed someone very special to me..
"A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
I'm sorry, Miss, one of us needs to keep surveillance...
I don't see anybody in there but you.
Was someone in an accident?
What are you doing on Theo's line?
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
What if they do question the authenticity?
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
You gotta just look the other way.
You could've killed us.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
Bullshit.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
You don't understand.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
You won't disconnect.
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Oh man.  These people mean business.
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
Fine, no tunnel.  Are you still with me?  Hello?
Pictures.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
A price on everything.
No.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Don't say that.
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
It won't be him.
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
Lucky for them they didn't.
What did you do?
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
There isn't any such person.
Whose money is this?
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
You timed that beautifully.
Do you have to point that?
You, I would've noticed.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
He wants 75 back.
It could be a fire.  This is Malibu.
They did some great job of reforming you.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
You're the man with the gun.
I picked the wrong number when I chose you ... didn't I?
I don't want it.
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
Satisfied?
My pleasure --
Negative.
And not a nickel.
Stop the crying.
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
How far off are you?
Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Was I picking on you?  How come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Can I make a quick call?
He agreed that he was.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Not in my experience.
The accent, I suppose.
Hi.
You want to know how I kissed him?
Yes...
Is this an obsession of yours?
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Sure I do.
Made me feel all funny inside.
Ask to meet me again.
Sorry.
Absolutely.
Are you pretending yet?
A little.
What?
Don't.
Come on.
And you're not going to tell me more?
Don't call me that --
I'm going home!
So tell me.
Good-bye, Dil
Your soldier.
You knew my Jody?
In a manner of speaking.
You killed my Jody
You didn't.
Love me.
Tell me you love me.
Say it again.
Not if you go.
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
Thirty-five.
As the man said, it's in my nature.
Lucky you.
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.
Do you now.
Can't.
He's hot.
Leave me alone, Jude.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
And what happens then?
You may be right.
Yes?
Dil!
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
Peter.
I thought it was Dave.
And who is she?
Who is he?
Eat something, would you?
How did you know it was her?
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
No fucking way.
You want to bet?
Not in your nature.
I'm talking about your people, not you.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Why not?
No?
What the fuck were you doing here?
Ever see hurling?
Why?
Like what?
I've often wondered how you do it.
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
What?
Why?
Stop that talk now --
You won't run.
You stupid bastard --
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
All right -- where's the letter?
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
I think that's what you ordered.
No -- I guess not.
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
Reggie -- listen to me --
Very sweet.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that!  Oh, dear.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Ours.
Because they're still here.
No, what?
That's not Carson Dyle.
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
Barely, yes.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
But no one actually saw him die.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
No.
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
No.
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
Yes.
But you're -- divorced?
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
Scobie?
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Tuesday.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
Who?
I'm scared.
What are you doing?
Shut the door!
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
I suggest you get about your business -- nothing soothes Herman like success.
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
I don't know.
I don't know.
In Mr. Dyle's room?
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
I don't know -- how would I know?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
Yes.
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
What are you doing here?
What's going on?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
What?
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
I believe what he said.
What are you talking about?
Words can hurt very much.
Stop that!
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
He knows everything.
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
Why?
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
Good.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
It's almost ten o'clock.
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
I'm not criticizing. _ Did you two get any further?
No honey.
No I wasn't.
We're seeing all the signs in town.
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
I can.
Daddy....
Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown. Kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. It's turning into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.
What?
Then you should go.
Mark invited me to the party.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
Stag?
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
I'm not using him as an excuse.
Jody. Wait.
Mom?
I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
How could you?
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
On what side of the family?
There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
What are you doing?
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
There's Jan and Heather. Let's grab them quick before someone else does.
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
...-ty.
Where's Sam?
Andy.  Another fuckin'...
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
Huh?
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
That dog ain't mean.
I'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. I'm gonna--  Don't tell me to shut-- It's none of your business.  Man, I can talk all I want to.

Damn.
...excuse me.  Can you fix this?
You'd better coast through...
Billings?  No, no, no, no, no.  We need to go to McGruder.
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
You stole this truck.
You stole this truck! That's...
Take your gun!
Okay!  All right!
 Nice job back there.
Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
 No...
...-er!
Every time I look at you, I wanna hit...
I did not steal the truck.
...waiting!
Oh, shit.
...up!
...do we?
Come on!
...easy, easy, easy.
I know the likeli-...
Come on, old...
 Oh...
 ...shit!
Hang on!


What?
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
It won't even start half the time.
And he swore, he swore once I got a degree...
...truck.
We were nationally  ranked.
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...


Listen, Arlo.
We're gonna die!
Arlo!  Arlo.
Reach into my pocket.
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.

What?
You got Elvis?!
...tunnel!
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
 What's it say? 
Forty-nine point four.



We got-...
...another way  outta here.    Hey.


Who drove the ice cream...
...face" crap you've been telling me?
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
It all started with our mission in Istanbul.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
Be cool.  Be--
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
...without compunction.
And it won't be pleasant. 
Well, that just about figures for today.
So...where's my truck?
...help you?
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
However, you are also non-en-...
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
...including the permanently extreme.
Any of them Richard Long?
And I changed the schedule.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
Look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
...here, and the White House is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.

No, go--
...that.
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...

Yeah, I had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
...Destry, Fair Oaks....
...here!
I'll do it.
This is it.
Well.  It appears someone's been lying to us.
Check the immediate area.
You can't fire on them.  You're gonna detonate the crystals.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
...here!
Officer Pappas, I'm glad you're here.
...-mand out of Fort Bragg.
...-ty.
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
Well, then, how about a cup of coffee, Darlene?
I beg your pardon?
Not tonight...
Odd, then, that his car...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
Yeah, I'm listenin'.
I don't see my container.
It's a little late for matinee heroics, Mason.  Just give me the con-...
...and unharmed, de-...


You'd never understand!
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
There's something else too.
Uh, we both like to fish.
You got thirty minutes.
Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--?

Thanks. 
What the hell are you talkin' about...
Excellent.
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as I do.
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...
How can we ever hope to win against the trout?
...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
You're the only one I can trust.
...-m-means, Mason.  

Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
...there's a colonel...
  All right.

He must've had a damn arsenal in there.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.
Would you call him a capable man?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
Why is that funny?
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
Avocado groves?
Is she all right?
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
How much are you worth?
Do you remember the figures we discussed?
What are you talking about?
What kind of guy do you think I am?
Sure thing.
Off the alley.
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
I said okay, Jake.
The apple core club.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
What pictures?
I heard it was an accident.
What for?
Give you three minutes.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
It looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. Could he swim?
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
I should talk this over with your husband.
My husband.
Unless what?
Yes... why?
You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
You sure shout that?
Of course I'm sure.
There was a memorial service at the Mar Vista Inn today for Jasper Lamar Crabb. He died three weeks ago.
Maid's night off?
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
It was in Chinatown.
Hold still. Why?
That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
Okay, give me the keys.
Sure.
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
Katherine.
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
How do you know?
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
Oh, good.
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.
I said, the northwest valley.
Yeah.
Mr. Gittes...
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
He owned the water department?
Yes.
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
This?
Yeah?
Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
Course, she settled down nicely.
Why'd she run away?
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
So I can have these? 
Fifty lire... 
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing. 
Why? What do you mean?
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world! 
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 
Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll see. And you won't recognize the kids any more, they're grown up by now.
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
Three cents.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
But please, Mr. Kane, don't buy any more paintings.  Nine Venuses already we got, twenty-six Virgins - two whole warehouses full of stuff -
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
So then, tonight, we go over everything thoroughly, eh?  Especially the new papers -
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
Enthusiastic?
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you.  I'll be in it, too, won't I?  And Junior?
What's the matter with you?
Where's the towel?
Would you sing for me?
Oh, no, that's all gone.
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
You're the greatest fool I've ever known, Kane.  If it was anybody else, I'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you.  Only you're going to need more than one lesson. And you're going to get more than one lesson. 
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
I happened to see your consolidated statement yesterday, Charles.  Could I not suggest to you that it is unwise for you to continue this philanthropic enterprise -  this Enquirer - that is costing you one million dollars a year?
Get Dr. Corey.
Is Mrs. Kane - 
Yes, sir. 
Persia.  It belonged to a king.
That's the second sentence you've started with "I" -
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
Good.
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
I'm drunk.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
It's a letter from her lawyers.
He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
Yeah, all in crates.
Or Rosebud?  How about it, Jerry?
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
Thompson!
That's the whole works, right up to date.
How did you meet him?
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
He was in love with me.  But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
Well, if it's already too late...
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
Excuse me, but...
Hey, now wait a sec...
What better place than this? To stamp it out, you gotta start at the source!
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
Dick.
You're kidding.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
I'm not pregnant.
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
But can we date?
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
You mean, on a date?
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
You have a better suggestion?
I hear that's a rather popular date.
I'm just kidding.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
Like what?
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
What time was this?
Are you open?
If you can just wait a few more minutes.
I can pass!
Well, he missed!
Pack of cigarettes.  Congratulations. I saw that announcement in today's paper.  She's marrying an Asian design major.
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
No, thanks.
You win.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Eight and a half?
She called me Brad.
What do you mean?
Great story, isn't it?
That's frightening.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
What about Veronica?
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.
Empire.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
It would stand to reason, yes.
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
What's a jizz-mopper?
Let's hear it.
I'm going to miss the game.
Sorry.
Pull my laces tighter.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
Design major.
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!
Oh, my god.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.
I'm going with you.
You know.
I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
What?
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
There's no lights back there.
You just fucked a total stranger?
Am I right or what?
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
Do you work tomorrow?
Just the paper.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
Do I know you?
I'm her sister.
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
Yeah?
A half hour.
With you? I don't think so.
What's that mean?
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
She's my girlfriend.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Oh... Can I help you?
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Yeah, but...
I said go ahead.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Typically male point of view.
And I actually date you?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
Three.
Three?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
That's because I never had sex with him!
Let it go...
Something like thirty-six.
Hey! Where are you going?!
What did he say?
And that made you feel better?
The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it...
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
I didn't do that!
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
Does he sing in English or Russian?
I do about three-fifty, four.
That's tight. Solid.
Sure. How about the beach?
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
You're not?
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
Which one?
Twenty bucks?
Bye. 
Fuck you.
Jessie, Jessie, copy?
What usually eats a banana?
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
I love you, too.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
Take the gun.
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
Patience my love, patience.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
I don't think you do.
I don't expect you to understand.
You couldn't.
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
Maybe lead to a flare up...
Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
Call me sentimental.
Why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.
No luck?
We might be able to go that way.
Never
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
What about you?!
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
You said there was a way across.
Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Great, sir. Great.
No. She's dead!
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
You've not been to school all week, son.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been doing something you shouldn't. Yes? He shakes Alex's hair.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
Fine, fine.
Well, how are you then?
Oh, aye, aye.
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
Right. Sign here for your valuable property. Alex signs.
How're you feeling this morning?
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
But it was horrible.
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
How are you feeling today?
I haven't seen you before.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
Good. What do you want?
Good. I'm glad
You're not cured yet, my boy.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
Father, I have tried, have I not?
I've done my best, have I not?
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
One pair of underpants - white with blue waistband.
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
Don't read it - sign it!
Hullo, son, how are you?
Go ahead, say it.
You dizzy?  You want to sit down?
Jesus...
Remember what you played?
The crowd had to dig it.
What kind of question?
Lay it on me.
Federal?
Very generous.
So?
They found him dead in his own cab down by the Port Authority.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
...if they're wrong?!
What's your name?
I brought you flowers.
What's he sayin'?
I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
Twenty-four minutes.
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
It's not that kind of job.
Oh?  How long you been doing this?
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
I tried it.
They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
Yes.
What'd he do to you?
Who was he?
I don't know any Rwandans.
Get rid of 'em.
How?
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
Lenny?  You're an asshole.
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
Collateral damage.
But, hey, some good news.  This last one put me way ahead of schedule. We've actually got some time to kill.  Jazz?  You like jazz?
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
You're the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  You like the man, you like the way he plays.  How about a little jazz, huh?
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
Our friends in Little Russia.  Go in and ask for a man named Dmitri.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
You're full of shit.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
None of your business.
Slow down!
The sound of love.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
I think you're different.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
Just relax.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Them who?
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
You want something to drink?
I've been reading up on it.
Never heard of him.
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
Is this your dad?
What van?
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
I don't know what to say.  I love you.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
Back where?
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
Blue moon...
How did you know?
What about you?
I love you, too.
What's that?
We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
<u>Liza</u>!
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
Excuse me?
You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
The truth shall make you free.
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
A dog.
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
Which way did he go?
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
And Jonas?
Where do you think Jerry is?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
What in the hell...?
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
You're --
I'm surprised you even knew it was an election year.
No doubt.
It's not like you've given me much choice.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all.  Order in the chaos.  I'm practicing listening --
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
What is it?  What's happened?
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
Here, right around Centaurus A.
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
That's my scientist.
Why did you contact us?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
Many others.
No!  I mean... why so soon?
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
It's so... small.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
And?
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
-- I'm moving to Washington.
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
I don't think so.
I read your book.
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
I'm sorry.
Please --
I can't hear this now --
You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
I'll make it a dollar.
Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
What are you doin' here?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
Go hard!
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
What's all this dirt in the yard?
Captain says to wait 'til the Patrol gits here.
Here, Captain.
Borrowin' or payin' back?
Pair'a nines.
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
What happened? How far did you get?
Lemme see it!
A cold drink.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Whoee, it's cold. Wisht I had somethin' to eat. Bread, grits, beans even. Soon's we get to my house, we're gonna have us one big meal and then I'm gonna show you some farm girls that...
On my own.
Do we even get our same bunks back?
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
What's the writing say?
Oh Lord!
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
Well, how far didya get?
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A NEWSPAPER!
The moon is up, my night to howl. Will you be okay?
Where have you <u>been</u>?  What happened to your wallet?
We'll get the paramedics...
Tell her we're sorry we bothered her.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
What pattern was that?
When was that?
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
You know I can't do that.
You know where.
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.
Because of your phone calls.
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Would you want to work with us on this?
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
How did you know they were stockings?
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
He was in my apartment!
We don't see too many lady homicide detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect. Have you discussed the note with Dr. Hudson?
Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a pattern develop...
Michael Johnson.
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
My third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.
Answer it.
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
What about her arms?
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
I know.  Get out here.
He's not treating her right...
Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
There, that's better.
That's going well, then.
It does.
After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one?  I'm trying to find Charles's car.
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
Can you drive?
Hard to say.
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
Patient.
Then, you should call.
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
Things have been kind of stressful lately.
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
Chair, cup and ball.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
No.
Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
I wish I could have seen that.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
Do you?
I do.
Well?
Just checking.
Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
It's TV heaven.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
Good luck.
Yeah?
How may I help you?
No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
Always the drugs.
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
Yeah?
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Can you loan me a 20?
I'm going to the store.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
So will you?
No...
I heard about your friend.
I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
All tapped out.
How's it look?
Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
You didn't have to kill Sophie.
Hello?
C'mon, Laurant, America?
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
Good.   I'm good.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
I don't know.
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
Do I?
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
Hadley --
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
You haven't answered my question.
Did you have to use that much explosive?
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
Hey boss, it's not a science.
You know why I'm handling it very well? Because you're going to get these guys for me.
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
The Holiday Hotel.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
I'll drive.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
I'm not going to leave you.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
It's my idea.
We have a problem. Problem isn't the right word. Dilemma. No that really doesn't describe --  Do you know who that is?
Give it to me, Sami.
How?
No problem, man.  Hey, you wanna hit?
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
You're not helping.
And you don't speak French?
What does arresting us get them?
You ever hear of jet lag?
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
You got it in a bar?
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
No.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
She seems pleasant enough.
For me? What am I going to do with a piece of shit like this?
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.
Go ahead.
Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
You're already a thief.
Shut up!
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
You write gracefully.  Calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
Please.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
I'm just borrowing some clean clothes.  I'm not staying.
Let's end this here.
The antidote exists.  She taught it to me.  The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
When I was a boy, one night, I saw a thousand shooting stars.  I thought, where did they all go? I'm an orphan.  I used to look for stars alone.  I thought if I rode to the other end of the desert, I'd find them.  I've been riding in the desert ever since.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
Yes.
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
What do you have in mind?
Speak up.  Clear it with the Captain if you need a file.
Well, hello there...chocolate,
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
Another jolly nickname?
And how many lives have you destroyed?
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
I'm Kathryn.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
I read your teen beat manifesto.
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
Excuse me. Excuse me!
Romantic? He rapes her.
That's a matter of opinion.
I sincerely doubt it.
It was fine.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Okay.
I can't win with you.
You know what? I don't take it back.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Please don't go.
Hi.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
What are you saying?
You don't know how to love.
I'm sorry about that.
I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. What's his name?
Greg McConnell.
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Are you for real?
Something awful happened last night.
What do you mean?!
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
Just taking your photo.
You promised to let me kiss you.
Good night Cecile.
I know.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
Hi, mom.
Positive.
What's wrong?
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
I don't find this very funny,
I see your point... though why should I care?
Why not?
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
Loser.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
Moving along quite well.
You amaze me.
Yippy.
Where'd she go?
Kind of.
No, tell me.
It clearly is why.
No, I'm not.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
And if I don't?
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
Not at all. What's wrong?
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
She's out.
Annette! Annette!
Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Nope.
Hey Ronald.
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.
Mommy --
Where did you get this ring?
On the back street — a green house
But it's already come true.
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Irena.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
It's nearly a quarter after four. The party was for four, wasn't it?
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
She said something about that, Mrs. Reed — but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
Yes, daddy.
I didn't forget.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
No, I didn't.
These are all from me.
Just you wait!
Daddy!
No.
Irena. But who are you?
I've wanted a friend.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
For as long as you'll let me.
A princess?
Oh, how beautiful!
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
It stands so still.
Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
Hurry!
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
No it's mom.
We're worried about you. "60 Minutes" was on same-sex couples.
My shrink says he's not so bad.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
Where are all the mediums?
Can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
I'm sure they were exaggerating.
I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with Gregory.
How'd it go with the cop?
Frida, this hair thing is all in your head. You're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
I put it down the garbage disposal.
Oh no.
And he was missing an arm.
He's been here all night?
DON'T call the police.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
I could smell another woman on him.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
Guess she never found true love.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
I'm really tired.
That's okay. I just have to use the bathroom and then I'll leave.
Knock what off?
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
No?
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
I really gotta get going.
Goodnight.
You had a date with Carlton?
What happened?
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
You didn't say it.
I'm going to take a shower.
I think I'm a werewolf.
I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting along?
You can't believe this bullshit.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Looks like you need a haircut to me.
All the same entry wounds.  It's definitely him.  She lives...  lived here.  A prostitute.
Dammit!
Yes, sir.  Anything wrong?
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
What does she say?  The woman.
Your name is John White.
Horrible...
I'm nothing then.
What are you hiding?
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
Don't say a .
What?
Holy cow.
Mr. President...
Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
Nightmare...
TilT we figure something out.
Clean.
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
You're kidding.
Three years.
He's only doing what you told him to.
Bob...
I'll lock him away for good.
You could buy it on payments.
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
Wrong...
This is from the people of Burundi...
Oh... Thanks.
Really?
What?
You got a gun?
I was waiting for that jack.
You mean with you and everything?
I care about the homeless.
... . Ellen.
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
Are you hungry?
I can't.
Hi.
Who's this priest I'm thanking?
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
Then why did you come here?
How did you know we were on this island? Do others know? Will others come?
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
Tonight?
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
What?
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
Shhhhh....Tony. Rest, rest.
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
You're....you're disgusting! You're....FILTH!
I had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr. Tyler is in big trouble with the...authorities.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
You fired that shot, didn't you?
Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
Do they go to Henley Hall?
At Chet Danburry's house.
It's every bit as hard as they say. Unless you're a genius like Meeks.
Well, of course not.  It's just that... You could have warned us.
Oh God, it's over now!
Nuwanda?  Please?
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
I don't know about anyone else, but I could use a refresher in Latin.  Eight o'clock in my room?
Where'd you find them?
You what?!  How did you do that?
What happened?
It's all right, Chet.
Hello?
Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
Are you going with Chet?
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Knox, you are so infuriating!
I have to go home. Chet might call.
Yes sir.
Meeks.
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
Again!  Louder!
LOUDER!
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
Where are you going?
Any group pictures in the annual?
Father!
Look at this.
Why'd you leave Balincrest?
My brother went here.
Nothing.
Want to come to the study group?
Yes.  But
And now he will?
Come on, that's impossible.
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
Lots of girls.  The girl who plays Hermia is incredible.
Do you have to quit the play?
You the Captain?
I once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle, then he corked it, sealing it tight, and threw it to a baby octopus. The little sucker felt its way around that bottle, and in less than two minutes, got that cork off, slid inside, and ate that fish.
Right here...middle of nowhere...
We were talking about my schedule...
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
What other bunch?
I'm not rich people.
I don't know where it is!
How do you know that?
What is it?
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
...Jagger was here...I was here...
I think he knows that Joey.
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
What's there to think about?? That THING back there...
Here's to huntin'.
I know, but...
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
You talk to him?
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?
See, I'm going home.
Where is he???
She's in back.
Those fuckin' niggers. This time I'm going to eat balls!... You ever try 'em?
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
But --
You're going hunting?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
You seem... disturbed.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
That way it sets.
Huh?
You do?
You have to think about the shot. It's the shot. The shot's it.
Nick, he just came back.
What'd he say?
You think we'll ever come back?
Hunt with Vince?
You're right... Okay, you're right.
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
Watch it, shithead!
Right.
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
Did you go hunting.
I tracked this one, a big buck. God, he was such a beauty--! What's this suitcase here?
Yeah!
Naw.  Uh-huh.
Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.
Down.
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
Speak up.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
Hello Wade.
Remember my promise.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
Just great.
You sure?  I can help you.

See those guys?
Bacon cheeseburgers.
Wanna try?
This is the guy that killed my partner.
You never want to find out.
They always are.
Yeah.
Hi.
Let's dance together -- Belle.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
What's that, sir?
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
Stevens!
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
Leave your tongue off of that!
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Headache -- Squire?
But -- I was just lucky.
How do you do, Belle? How are you, Jabez?  Well -- mighty elegant house you got here.
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
What is that smile on your face?  Is there anything wrong with me?
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
But I'm glad to be home again --
You'll never change -- will you?
Mary --
Mary! I'm -- Selectman of Cross Corners!
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
Isn't that your own fault?
It shows on your face.
Jabez -- Jabez!
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
Do you really think that?
I say -- it don't matter.
You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
Let her be, son. She'll do all right. You better get yourself straightened out.
I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
Jabez ...
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
Your Honor -- gentlemen of the jury -- this case need not detain us long. It concerns one thing alone -- the transference, barter and sale of a certain piece of property, to wit, his soul by Jabez Stone. That transference, barter or sale is attested by a deed. I offer that deed in evidence and mark it Exhibit A.
I want someone to talk to ...
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
Oh...Where does he live?
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
How do you know?
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
This is --
You'll be okay.
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
Don't call yourself fat.
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there?
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Yeah...
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
So!  Sal is with you?
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
What do you want to know that for?
Listen, Sonny ... can I call you Sonny for short?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
You frisk me.
What?
Sonny, be reasonable!
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
I want to talk to him.
Hey... let him out!
It's all we got.
For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got.
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
Mister Mulvaney?
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
Thanks again, Sam.
You were terrific, too!
Yeah.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
Where's the money?
Goddamn women...
It's the cops.  Shit!
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
Hey, Sal ... How you doin'?
Bullshit!
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
Nobody give their right name ... it's the FBI!
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
That's the jet.  You give us one more, now.  That's the deal...
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
What's the matter... they never housebroke you?
What are you trying to pull?
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Hey, let's get ready!
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
Why are you doing this?
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
This is Bishop.
Where are we going?
Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
<i>The driver's name was Locus Fender. We know that he was in on the heist.</i> <b> INT. ARMORED CAR -- NEXT </b> LOCUS FENDER  is behind the wheel of the armored car. His unshaven, disheveled appearance looks totally out of place in his security uniform. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Taryn is now scrawling notes on a pad.
Are you aware that Lateesha Rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?
<i>The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.</i>
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.

Why must you fight... everything that is normal? You are blessed with such beauty. Life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino.
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
Cool it, Choco.
And he used to fuck a Playboy centerfold every night.
You were good.
Just like Billy Ocean says. <i>When the going gets tough...</i>
I be.  I'm living large.
What did he do this time?
Did you ask Sal?
Don't come back, either.
What?
You the man.
Make it plain.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
Gotta go.
OK.  OK.
What makes Sammy run?
Fifty cents.
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
...peanuts.
D, not C.
Mister Señor Love Daddy, I'd like to dedicate the next record to my heart, Tina.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
Naw, that's some stupid shit.  Now you know how I got that name.
Do we now?
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
When?
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Hot.  Hot.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
You a blue-moon fool.
Tina, you're sweating.
Later for you.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Pino, I think secretly that you wish you were Black.  That's what I think.  Vito, what do you say?
It's e-vit-able.
Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
Yeah.
Sez who?
Hey!  Watch it.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
Turn it off.
You're it.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
Are you trying to be funny? Or are you actually re--, re...special
HARRY? Are you okay?
My mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
Hey look, it's our teacher.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
What?
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
The second R is silent.
We're part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, I mean Ms. Heller. Maybe you'd like to join us, it doesn't require any walking.
Sounds like a pirate.
Peg leg?
Will not.
That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night.
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
Nice jugs.
You're it.
Owww... refreshing.
Nope. I was right.
That's a cow, Harry.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
Me, me, me!
He's like the Pope. Like we're gonna snake a girl away from the Pope.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Guys, this is much better.
The one on the left.
Try one in a million!
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
I thought I told you to get lost.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
You know, "some". The fag stuff.
I'm so close I can feel it.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
That's the downside. There is none.
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
Thanks for the grub, Mrs. D. Where's Mr. D?
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Obviously.
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
It's the big potato.
No. No. That's not it. We don't kill him. We don't kill anybody. But I like the way you're thinking. You're focused and you're trying to follow. No, what we need to do is start a fake Special Needs class.
We start our own class?
You said "aloha" twice.
What?
Where is it?
Are you going to kill her?
It was Feyd?  It was Feyd!  Where is the ducal signet ring?  I must have his ring.
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
I'm sorry Gurney.
Paul!!  Paul!!
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
Your Reverence.
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.
My own name is a killing word.  Will it be a healing word as well?
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.
Thank you.
Well... I guess I should go.  Perhaps we could get together again?
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
Should I call a doctor?
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
So why didn't you do it?
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
You mean a Tesla coil?
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
What do you think you're doin'?!
This is kind of a stream--
Wow.
I don't understand.
Bravo!  Bravo!  Magnifico!
Isn't he?
It's a damn good role.
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
Dolores, wait!
For this one, we need $60,000.
What other sixty-thousand?
Really?!  Well good for you.
Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
Well, Mr. Feldman, I don't believe in thinking small.  So I've got a whole slate of pictures for you: "The Vampire's Tomb," "The Ghoul Goes West"... and "Doctor Acula"!
"Graverobbers From Outer Space"! It's <u>money in the bank</u>.
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Tor!
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
I like.  When do movie shoot?
Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Tor, I should be getting home.
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
Yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  It ain't gonna be the Christine Jorgensen story no more. Goddamn "Variety" printed the story before I had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
So you're not a fruit?
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
Oh, it's you again.
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
You should feel lucky.  Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
I can't get it to go up.
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
Wow.
At what point?
No.
Al!!
So?
How you doing, Ed?
Ed, do you want my advice?
This guy.
What about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I'd hate to think he...
Al!
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Eddie? ...
Yeah?
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
I mean, that worked out.
Both.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
Mom?
Who?
The doctor said you were having sex.
Oh my god! On TV!
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
Hi, Mom. 
No.
What is she, at work?
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
They're gonna mock our foibles.
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
How much less?
Well, then I'm quitting.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
So maybe this is my dynamite.
You do though, you look great.
Ha!
Go!
Oh yeah.
I know, I ...
Shari...
Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
I'm sorry.
Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
It's not their fault.
This is going right up your ass.
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
What?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
What?
Yeah?!
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
Oh, man! So...
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
That girl's an idiot.
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
Ohhh...
Don't tell me that.  I don't want to know that.
In love?
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
Mostly Tammy fans
Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for VP, Treasurer and Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
You know what they say about the early bird.
I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
NO, that's fine
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Sure
What do you mean?
I'm looking at new cars.
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
You'll be fine.
What is it. Tammy?
This weekend.
And how did you get in the school?
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
I can't afford this stuff right now.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Yep.
Right now?
Three twenty-five.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Paul, get out!
You dumbshit!
We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
Can I get you a drink?
How'd she meet Patchett?
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
You know him?
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
Easy.  Tell me about the ruckus.
Yeah, that's Stens.
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
You know, all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father.
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Wendell White, how's tricks, <u>paesano</u>?
I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
Believed what?
I don't own no shotguns.
Say what?
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
That's right.
You make a mistake?
What?
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
What are you going to do?
What's on the call sheet?
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
Do you have any proof?
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Something like that.
Really?  How?
And you were the last one to talk to him.
What'd he say to you?
Nothing.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Listen to me--
Listen--
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
What kind of a question is that?
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
Who are they?
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
What <u>is</u> that?
Wait. What do I do?
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
No shit.
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?
Sorry.
How do you know so much?
I intercepted phone calls.
Why'd you leave?
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
What's going on?
<u>Here</u>?!
Gimme that.
Goddammit--
So what do we do now?
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
What if--
The thing is...it really can't wait.
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
Neil, thank you for your help.
That's fine.
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
Yes. I have her permission.
I know, but--
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
Sorry.
You <u>swore</u>!
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
The date stamp on the picture is last <u>month</u>. Is that where you and Rachel conduct business.
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
That's okay.
It's a brand new card.
Is this a fuckin' joke?
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
Actually, that's not true.
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
Other than Brill.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
Rachel--
How?
I can't.
Diane, maybe you didn't hear Mr. Silverberg. They've got models that'll try on the garments.  Thank you, sir.
Good point.
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
Are those my Christmas presents?
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
Alright!
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
No, but they took my blender.
Yeah?
Bobby--
Are you still in Crystal City?
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
He had help.
Dean's with Lyle.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Excuse me?
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
Excuse me?
As the wife of one of our party.
He said - be careful.
You should come into the shelter.
I'm impressed you can sew.
What?  No!
This is - what is this?
Arabic?
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine!  I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
What kind of photographs?
Very well.
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
How are you?
Okay.
I don't know.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
Go!  Hey!  Go! Caravaggio is in terror.
Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
You were in Africa?
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
What if I told you he did this to me?
I liberated it.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
How?  How can you see anything?
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
Is something funny?
What do I do?
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
What are you up to?
It's what I've learned.
I'll always go back to that church.
And what if he really is a spy?
Why Picton?
Third Canadian Fusiliers.
He's gone, hasn't he?
No.  He's - no.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?
What are you talking about?
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
Where are you at least?
He's on to something bigger.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
You have a car?
I'll call an ambulance.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
Well, no...but...
Very nice.
What about your bags?
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
Let's do it again.
Did I hear a car?
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
Camera in the--
We're working.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
The eight billion. From them to us.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
There's always a surprise.
You have something in mind?
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
Relax, don't jam it...
Hang on.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
But--
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
The key to success is using the right tools.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
We're supposed to.
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
You're giving them to me?
Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
All of 'em?
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
Hi.  Donna Irving?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
If you hadn't used profanity --
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
You're a girl.
I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
So what made you think it was?
Okay.  A 5% raise, and --
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.
Hey.  I like working with you.
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
I did.  Both.
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
I guess I did.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What kind of chromium is it?
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
I do.
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
You're not nothing, Erin.
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
Nothing.
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
I can't leave my job, George.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
Have you been logging on?
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
I know.  It's an awful lot.
It'll be fine, yeah.
Who's Baxter?
Soon, Lord Vader.
And that is why I must go.
Okay, Chewie, it's now or never.
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
Yeah ...
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.
What is it?
What was it?
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
Sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
What are you staring at?
That won't be easy, my friend ... What brings you here, anyway?
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
Not really.
You're part of the mining guild then?
A tremor!
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
Free your mind and return he will.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
And sacrifice Han and Leia?
The Hoth System?
Yes, My Lord.
Did you call the Zoo?
They look pretty docile.
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Where's Plissken?
He's... near.
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
That's the deal.
Lock fuel rods.
Where are they?
Where are they going?
Me too?
Yeah, kinda.
What're you doing in here?
Are you crazy?
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
Don't follow me.
My King, I couldn't do it. Excalibur cannot be lost. Other men--
Good day to you, sir.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
In the great book.
What?!
A king must marry, after all.
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
Yes.
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
I will muster a great force of knights, and I will return to fight for what is mine.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
A lovestruck page!
It's done. A truce. We meet at the river.
--What issues from your lust will be mine. Swear it again.
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
No, he's working on another book.
Hello?
What's this?
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
Burke.
I'm gonna miss you.
Oh, I see.
I lied. It's for me. The spelling is on the back, Kinderman. You know that film you made called Angel? Isaw that six times.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
And those lies she's been telling?
Lies?
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Where?
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
Please.
She...killed Burke Dennings.
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
Well, not while we're in Washington.
When can I have one?
Hey, where'd this come from?
Captain Howdy, Do you think my mom's pretty? Captain Howdy? Captain Howdy that isn't very nice.
I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
You like him.
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
But you like him.
I don't know, I just thought.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
What are you doing here?
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
Hi Chris. Great party.
Oh, Christ.
Think you can sleep?
Withering Heights.
You might loosen the straps then.
I'm not Regan.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
No now.
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.
No.
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
I've seen him.
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Who's in it?
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
Your mother sucks cocks in hell Karras, you faithless slime!
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
Are you a relative?
Twelve.
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Why not?
What's our friend's problem?
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Out.
How we doing?
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
So we on tomorrow night?
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
You got weird kids, Frank.
Funny.  Strike a bell?
So do I.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
It wasn't like that.
No?
I'm not unhappy.
Come on, stand still.
It's not gonna hurt you.
No.
Just a lucky guess.
Yeah.
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on.  Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit.  Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move.  We could use another appetite.
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
Have some more wine, Frank.
Yeah.
We're gonna be here a week?
She's a big girl.
What the hell are these?
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
What do you mean?
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
What channels it on?
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Jack!
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Christ, that's right.  How could I forget.  What a nightmare.
You sure?
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
Well, that's fine --
Uh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
Uh... he knows it.
I wear a seven.
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
What do you think?
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
I said I was sorry.
Great.
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
Thanks, Lloyd.
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
Thanks.
You never sang before?
His kid's sick.
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
Like a baby. You?
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
Nothing.
What'd I say?
How do you know?
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
Oh. So what's it doing here?
Huh?
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
What are they?
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
Ivory.
Why not?
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Sure.
Or reactivated the first one.
A few blanks?  Like what?
For what?
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
How come?
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
Christ, Jon!  How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us?  Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
Which ear was it?
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
-- Castor?
Stay away from my family!
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
You'll what?
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
What?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
Gone?
-- what?
Nothing.
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Excuse me?
Stop Jack, I'm getting all weepy.
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
And I know people.
Take you, for instance...
Jack, are you okay?
We’re almost done here...
On a case by case basis...
I think I could figure it out.
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
Where do I go now?
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
What are you doing?
What am I saying?  You don’t need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that’s all.  Is that you?
You see, it’s like we’re in each other’s heads...
She is relentless.
Pretty much.
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You’re doing well...
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
No.
How'd you know my name was Jack?
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
Miss me, Jack?
Brought what on myself?! I didn’t do anything!
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
For us, Kate.
I was in the city.
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Look, we don’t have time for this right now, we’ll talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  You’re not wearing that to the Thompsons’ party. I don’t care how hilarious you think it is...
What are you doing?
Hello!
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
I think it worked out okay, don’t you?
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Why’d we ever leave?
C’mon.
What...?
I found it at an outlet store.  I know it’s a knock-off, but I think it’ll look great on you...
You actually forgot our anniversary.
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and you’ve seen my pay check.
I could stay here forever...
Think bigger.
You’re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
Annie goes to a great school.
Are you okay, Jack?
To Paris. Paris, France.
Don’t do this, Jack... But he continues...
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I’ll be fine...
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
For one thing, you like expensive things.
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
We're working as hard as we can --
Reed said it'd be weeks till --
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
The suit will stretch.  You should try it --
It's easy for you to be patient.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
What do you mean "complete"?
What?
Victor's right.  Johnny, get to the command center.  Close the shields.
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
So are you!
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Not this again --
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
You two need a time-out.
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
And if he's not...?
Our numbers are through the roof.  The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share.  The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here.  And keep it quiet.  I don't need this to hit the press.
Didn't go as <u>planned</u>?  It was a <u>catastrophe</u>.  You ruined the lives of four people --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
What are you doing?
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Of course.  Of course.
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us <u>worse</u>, maybe even kill us.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
What is it?
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
[LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
We must!
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
What do you mean?
Better Judgment?! To wait until the actual operation -- when it may be too late?
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
The Medieval Philosophers were right... <Man> is the center of the Universe... We stand in the middle of Infinity, between Outer and Inner Space. And there's no limit to either.
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
About forty miles an hour.
A what?
Just one little transistor and a circuit wire is all it takes.
I don't believe that.
Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
What's wrong, Skipper?
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
Was there any damage?
What do you mean?
...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.
Where is Pancakes Hause?
...Would it kill you to say something?
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Oh, Jean's okay. But there's three people up in Brainerd who aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
We sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
Mr. Mohra?
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
Uh-huh - in what way?
Where you girls from?
Uh-huh.
A subconscious-type thing.
Jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
What's the next step here, Jerry?
You bet.
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Huh? Yah?
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
No. No, ma'am.
but do you know that for sure without -
...If it's so damned important to ya!
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
My patience is at an end.
Ya got the car?
Yah.
Stan Grossman called.
Wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal I was talkin' about, those forty acres there on Wayzata?
What's goin' on there?
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
No kiddin'?
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Yah.
Yah.
How's it look, Marge?
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
Yah, sorry, so I was married to Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?  She was a year behind us.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
Yah?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
The day of our homicides.
And this guy is...
Copy.
Thanks, hon.
Oh, fine.
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Your mallard?
Where's Tyler?
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Bob was a champion bodybuilder.  You know that chest expansion program you see on TV?  That was his idea.
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
No, I wasn't aware...
Dynamite?
It means it was homemade.
What?
And I saw you practicing this...
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
I don't know ...
Do you care?
Hear what?
We've just lost cabin pressure.
Say my name.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
What?
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
Who's this?
You were in here last Thursday night.
My suitcase was vibrating?
Tell the other person how you feel.
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
I guess so.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
I don't... think so.
Well, I have to file a claim...
A hotel?
A nice, big cock.
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
What fight?
If you could fight any celebrity?
Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
Unbelievable, huh?
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
What... ?
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
Tyler...
Something on your mind?
You know what I mean.
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
... is over.
Why do people think I'm you?
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
Is this really news to you?
What about Marla?
You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
Bob was a grown man.  In any great struggle, there will be casualties. Wouldn't that be implicit in the name?  Project "Mayhem."
I swear on my life, I won't...
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
What?
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Robert Paulson?
His name is Robert Paulson!
Ain't that something?
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby.
Speed up.
Should we knock?
A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene.
Carter.
Calm down, Kimmy.  It's not drugs, just weed.
I've got to stop and help those people.
Yeah?
I got that beat.  So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.
Alright miss, calm down.  I just need this lane open.  I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder!
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
I tried calling last night but your father --
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
4:25.
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
"Intervention?" What are you, God now?!
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father...
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
Get control of yourself!
You guys are real... aren't you?
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot... We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?
What's that?
Hell.  This is just like fucking Star Wars, man!
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
We'll check it out.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
How do we get upriver?
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Spooks?
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
Christ.  How'd you get here?
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
What was that?
Not yet.
You think they'll find any?
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
What did you want?
Let's do it.
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
...SO...anybody special in your life?
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
Tragedy?
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Well there....  What's the difference?
Please don't hurt me?
Have I died?
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
<u>What</u>?!
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
The Red Knight!
What?
Happily married, probably.
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
I don't drink coffee...
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Cerveza.
Serveza yourself!
You can sing the song.
I know you're not.
Who said I was depressed?
Come on.
Can I get you anything else?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
Well, you seem very professional...
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Daddy's very ill.
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
What have you been doing since then?
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
Swimming?
If you're free.
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
I have played a few times. Here and there. As a matter of fact, I was once a rehearsal pianist for a Las Vegas musical revue.
None.
Yes, it was. You've made it clear that if I can cut a little piano, I might get a little response.
No inner feeling.
No, I can't...
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
Come on, get moving, dammit!!
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
No, it's okay.
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
You better hold onto your tongue!
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
Fine.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Who are you?
What are you doin' here?
So what's her name?
No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
Who gives!
For real?
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
I think he's 18 or 17.
You gonna talk to him?
You here to see somebody?
Who?
What she look like?
No.
Where you know Amanda from?
Yes sir, you are confirmed on Flight 306 to Rio tomorrow evening at 11 PM. First Class.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
Hey, what are you doing?
What? What are you talking about?
You're lucky.
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
Greetings, everyone.
This one's going to be even more fun.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
Right.
It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Breathe easy...
Like when?
I think I’d rather have drugs.
Fletch...
Thought so. What for?
You don't have a piece of the action?
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
You're in the Records Room.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Cash. I'm impressed.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
They serve dinner on the flight?
Can I steal you for a minute?
Did you hear something?
I wonder if that's his doctor.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
What's he doing in Utah?
Hi.
I mean put clothes on.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Can I ask you a question?
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
He never sees them and I never met them.
What is this?
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
I commend him on his choice.
What did you want under the bed?
Tell the cops.
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
What about finding the source?
Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
Get out of here.
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
You were going to can me, right?
Who's Frieda?
I said, I ain't got you...
I said, I ain't got you...
Sorry about the glass.  And the house.  And the breath.
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Excuse me?
Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
Who?
I'll do my best.
Art Mo-o-o-ney!
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
All your friends call you Jazz.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
Contacts.
After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
You gave it to the girls for one.
Hello?
Ford, you were right!
Nice left you got there, jerk.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
Fine!
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
You were saying, snapperhead?  I'll bet you're not smiling now!
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
The point?
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Shock.
It doesn't have to be like this?
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Boca?
Doesn't register.
Got a wife named Angie.
Takin' care o' business, honey.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Le sommes nous?
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
What's your story?
Get up on the bar and show me how you work.  If I like it you don't have to go in.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
Why not?
Yeah.
This fella Nicoli's got a record in France, Walter.  He's wanted for questioning in the murder of a French cop.
What was it?
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
Yeah.
Why haven't they killed the juice?
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
Did he?
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
The future guy?
Hey, bud.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
I think you know, Frank.
What do you mean?
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
Frank, this is insane...
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Wait...
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Queens, New York.
What?
...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
Sorry 'bout that.
What'd you just say?
You call your son Little Chief?
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
What the hell...
That's impossible.
What's that?
What?  What is it?
Whatta you mean she's not here?
October 22, 1969.
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
I know...  But Dad, you can't go back.  You didn't die in that fire.  And no matter what you do, nothing is gonna change that.  So all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
John, he's got my driver's license.
What?
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Right, now I need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
John.  John, you all right?
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Uh, huh.
Wife around?
I hear that.
Who are you?
Fuck you, asshole.
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
Breakfast?
I don't know...
Think you can figure it out?
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
Did you stay here last night?
No.  I got here just before you did.
This is too painful to look at.
You know him?
Why don't you help us?
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
Is... is everything all right?
Please... be cool.
I never said you were "nothing".
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
Will you hurry up!  I gotta get this fuckmobile back before Horace finds out I took it.
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
What it is?
Daddy, what is going on?
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
Are you sure this is gonna work? I mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
That's debatable.
But what if they try and scare us?
But what I get scared again?
Which is?
Why not?  I used to play it alone. I love murder games.  Have you ever played The Consulting Detective?
I don't know.  He called somebody, then took off.
Will you listen, dammit!
Why didn't you cremate him?!
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
You got me where you want me. There's no reason not...
-- look, just shut up.  Let's cut through the shit.  You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason Voorhees for ya'.  I'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  One hundred grand, non- negotiable.
Steven...
I need to talk to you.
Twenty.
Look, I don't want your money!
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
That's very colorful, chief.
For a good reason.
Sorry.
Randy, c'mon!
Wanna know how I did that?
I didn't kill her!
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
Never.
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
What murders?
But I thought...
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!
What are you doing in here?
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
I don't think that's such a safe idea
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Get in the boat, Rennie!
You pushed me...
Everything okay?
Really?
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
It's not that simple.
Did you have an accident in the lake?
I heard you weren't coming.
Can he really take us home?
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
No, we're not.
What do you mean?
Unbelievable.
What are we talking about?
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
You know about Adele.
What?
We're able to surprise each other.
Because we're completely mismatched.
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
What will we talk about?
I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
What do we want?
What's sexy?
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
How prominent?
I'll have whatever she's having.
All the failures, all the fatalism.
It's me. Nicky.
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
We must have been heroic.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
I lost it. I lose everything.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
What do you want me to do?
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
Why do you care?
They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
Have to hurry back.
What do you mean?
Sidney.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
What color?
Yes.
You've worked with Elliot?
A little.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Where are you going now?
Someone waiting for you?
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
Please! You're being foolish!
What do you expect when you talk like that?
Enough.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
Fortunately such news comes very slowly where I live.
He's waiting. He's not prepared to accept it will mean as much as you think.
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
Do you find me stubborn?
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
It must have been the only Non-violent campaign ever led by a man who wanted to kill everybody every day.
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
The fools!  Sorry...
Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such "exception" to.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
We don't have the manpower.
Positive saliva match.  The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
At least it's nothing contagious.
I have to know where you come from.
What about you?  What's in this for you, Eugene?
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
I've got enough on my mind without that.
Where are you taking her?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
You've already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  I have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
Antonio, the choir...
I'd have to bleach my hair.
Hugo!  I've found him!
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
No.
It was a mercy-killing after all.
You didn't know?
Why are we leaving?
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
I've got enough here.
There's a problem, Lamar.
I can't do this.
I'm not doing it.
You gotta be kidding.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
I get my own help.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
We'll try again.
Where did you get those?
You been okay?
That's not all of it.
It's just been a while.
Why are you laughing?
... Bank President, three tellers and one guard...
For exits off Main Street.
You know how I feel?
They checked in.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
Texas is a big state.
Are you hungry?
I want to say something.
You want to try with me?
Okay.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
How's Mama and the kids?
My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
How was that?
That's what I want.
Two years.
Something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?
I got a nurse in mind.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
Christ, what...
You shouldn't have shown the film to Frank.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Can I go now?
Really.
I call that regular.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
What was bugging Frank?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
Oh, do you?
Go on.
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
What girl?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Expect so.
Did my brother Frank find out?
And you didn't know her last name?
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a long time.
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
Nowt.
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
It's not like that, luv.
What is it?
My brother, Frank.
No. Are you tired?
Jack Carter.
Oh, you've been watching television.
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
Jack! I didn't like that.
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
If I'd known, I'd have fixed him up with something better.
Ask me?
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
They did.
We're stuck with this...
...this shit...
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
Yes.
Yes, it is.  And you know who's responsible?
No.
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
Someone should stand up and strike back.
What do you mean?
Yes...?
Something.  To pay them back.  Someone, someone should hurt them. Murray and Mitch.
Yes.
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
Yes.
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
...and rob the place...
So I'm making it concrete.
Why?
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
Fine.
I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You mean the board...?
I was at home, where were you?
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
Was I?
Thieves.
Did they catch...?
That's great.
I want to work today, that's why I came...
Just go to lunch.
I don't want to go to lunch.
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Williamson...Williamson, they stole the contracts...?
Excuse me, fella.
You have a problem?
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.
Under him?
Murray said...
...ah, fuck this...
Either way.  You're out.
Alright.
The leads are coming.
Mmm.
No.  It hadn't.
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
You did that?
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
They took the leads?
...yes...
What is it?
You're sure?
Twelve-fifteen.
Rick...?
Tuesday.
Today.  Today.  Which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement I wanted to go over with you in any case.
The check wasn't cashed?
No.  She told me "right now."
What...?
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
She told me not to talk to you.
You cashed the check?
Mountain View.  Eight units.
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
We had a slight burglary last night.
Are you alright?
On your pillow.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
Will you take me?
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
Yes, thank you.
Goddamn bitch.
I don't want to stay here...
Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
That's what I'm here for.
It was hard to have him killed.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
Fredo.  Where are you going?
I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
Am I a prisoner?
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?
Was it a boy or a girl?
Mike, at three and a half...
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
What the hell are you talking about?
Do you gamble?
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
Whose orders are these?
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
Kay, I told you...
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
The baby I lost...
Enjoy.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you.
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
I want you to settle on their terms.
Trust me; do as I ask.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
We worked it all out beforehand.
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
We got friends in the commission.
I'm talking about Italians!
What's this?
Thanks, doll.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
I wasn't going to try anything.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
What're you talking about?
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
Something I can do for you?
What is the good English?  All I know is bugger.  He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
No!
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
Nice place.
And your name is --?
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
You went to university?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone.
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
It's new.
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
I liked it.  We all did.
I don't like to talk about that.
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today.
Why not?
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
If that's okay?
Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?
My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
No.  It won't do.
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
You coming, Boone?
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
Does the yardman come today?
Yes?
Oh my God.  What's wrong, Mr. Whale?  Is it your heart?
Mr....Kay?
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
It's been a long time, Memphis --
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead, right?
Randall Raines ... It's been a long time ...  frowns) 'though I do I recall you as a man with style. You remember your old friend, Atley -- ?
I'm not interested --
I knew you'd say that.
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
What do you want from me?
Consider me gone, Detective --
Where you been, anyway?
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
Diane 1.
You guys have any skills at all?
How's it going -- ?
I miss Orville Redenbacher already --
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
Yes, I do, in fact. John Wayne in McO...
What are you doing back?
He doesn't return my calls. or my letters ...
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
Whatcha got left ... ?
We'll take it...
Yeah... You want a ride...
Yeah ...
This has nothing to do with any of that --
Something like that -
Hey, you want something to eat ?
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
Me.
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
Too early to tell. Nervous?
I've missed you, man ...
You boost her -- ?
You okay -- ?
What are we gonna do -- ?
Hospital.
Jim Rockford. ROCKFORD FILES.
Buy you a drink?
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
That what you want?
You mentioned that in your letters
No whistles, but a Club You bring a hack -- ?
Gosh, no. Lipstick? What next? Mascara, blush, floral-print dresses?
I think so... They're just... So ...
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
What about The Club ... ?
This time it's for real?
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
She does have one thing you don't.
Are you considering a comeback tour?
Who's "Eleanor?"
Not --
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
Paulie.  You're all I got.  I need help.
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
I'm in construction.
My bag. My bag.
The bag with the envelopes.
I'm gonna need some money.
You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
Stop! Stop!
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
Then you're safer in here.
Paulie was just talking about him.
we're gonna feed the bastard to the lions.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
Don't worry about it.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
I can't eat,  just get me some coffee.
Yeah.
It's a fait accompli?
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
Where'd you find such creeps?
I gotta go home.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
Stay there.
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
Yeah.
What? Come on!
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
Jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a Flyin' Fish?
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
You and Morgan throw?
Yeah, not tonight. Not any other night. He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
Jesus.
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
What'd you say about me?
I'm not sure--
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
And what do you see?
You're in a safe place, Will.
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
--Maker builds "K" to the "N." N is three to the K times--
Really?
Of course.
--Half-red, half-black--
I don't know what it's called.
Hey, how you doin'?
Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
Good to see you.
Since Nancy died.
Yeah.
I need someone with your kind of background.
My kind of background?
I got it.
I'll be okay.
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
He married his cousin.
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
--No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
Now wait a minute--
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
I got one of those too.
About thirty million to one.
You think so?
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
If you ever disrespect my wife again...I will end you.
So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
Why thank you.
No.
How'd it go?
Haven't called her.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
Gerry says the meeting went well.
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
You want to read it?
--No, have you had any experience with that?
It's not your fault.
Which one did you take, Will?
You're Welcome, Will.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
See ya.
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
Not far from here, South Boston.
Yeah.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Your house must have been a zoo.
Sometime. I don't know. Next week.
Fine.
Why is it important to you? If I inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Just for fun?
Will? Are you awake?
Come with me to California.
Yeah, I'm sure.
Why not?
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
No, you don't want to hear that.
You doin' the hirin'?
Ready, Pa?
Well, you said anybody can waltz... How'm *I* doin'?
Don't hold me so tight.
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
Can all of you work?
House 25. Number's on the door.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
But--but how we gonna eat?
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Maybe you should a got yourself a wife.
Been out travelin' around?
Ain't you seen your folks since then?
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
I'll tell 'em. But I don't know how. Never seen so many guys with guns. Wouldn't even let us talk today.
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
Want to work, do you?
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
You people got a lotta nerve.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
You take this.  I ain't hungry.
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
Make her easy, John. Watch her.
No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
Yes'm, that was it.
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
I could hide you, Tommy.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Which ones?
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Then who *do* we shoot?
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they!
What's this?
You sure you got ever'thing ready?
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Remember high school?
What do you want to do?
I want to be an actor.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
How long has it been?
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
That's it?
Where have I been?
Yes.
Flowers. That's funny.
You never could have kept this from me.
I was leaving.
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
Do you like the people you work with?
You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?
Hard to get good help these days.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
This?
And they want me to make up for it.
They were very upset.
This is not good.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
That's wonderful, Mom.
It's a place where religious people--
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
No, I don't have one.
Of course you will.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
Marty! It's me. Paul.
He sold me this bad boy.
What the hell happened to you?
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
I'm a professional killer.
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--
Shit.
Need a lift?
Poor thing.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Son?
How did you meet her?
Why didn't it work out?
Everything under control?
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
I don't care! We'd be together.
Why don't you go lie down?
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
You got everything you need?
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
That's not true.
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
How's everything?
Who's there?
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
I should go get some of her things.
No, let me go.
Okay.
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
How was the dinner?
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
I miss you, Annie.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
About what?
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Yes?
Nobody's using it. Silly for her to be driving back and forth when she don't know her way around that well...
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
Diane!
I don't believe they'll expect that.
Can we take a look at Bronty's foal when we're done here, Dad?
It'd be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
Why do you always wear that hat?
Of course I have.
She's an editor.
Mmm. An editor.
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
I can't... not yet...
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
Grace, I need you to come with me.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
It's warmer than I thought.
My parents are having friends from college over. They're really nice... They have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
"... and I said that"...
You just showing off for her!
Hey, darlin'.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
What?
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Ta-da!
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Dade?
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
How was school?
I'm fine.  Oh, and Dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
Talk to me.
That's Razor and Blade.
Fucked if I care, man.
What the hell is going on?
What?
I'm Crash Override.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Your slave?
We need your help.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
Why did he come to you?
There they are!
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Right, well my BLT drive on my computer just went AWOL, and I've got this big project due tomorrow for Mr. Kawasaki, and if I don't get it in, he's gonna ask me to commit Hari Kari...
It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
Die, dickweeds!
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
Hello?
So what are we supposed to do?
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
Congratulations.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
Purpose of visit?
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
Jamie needs a Halloween costume.
We've been better.
What does that mean?
Brady!
Get back!
You guys always look great.
How many people in the bus?
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
Like a sister?
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
Jamie, what happened?
Had enough?
Jamie!
Rachel!
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
This is 132, over.
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
He's been here.
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
Okay.
We just talked.
I don't see anything.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
Wait a minute here...
I'm scared.
Promise?
Ten minutes.
A man wouldn't do that...
You all right?
More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
Well, she's totally not here.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
Not any more.
There was no one outside.
Promise?
I saw him...
Tommy, I want you to go back upstairs...
How?
Laurie, you come with us...
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
Ever done anything like this before?
Shouldn't we pick him up?
What did he say?
Well, let's do it.
That's just --
I know.  It's terrible!
Uh...
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
I can't resist.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
Yes.
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Page a hundred and twelve.
Bye.
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Oh.
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
I can't say anything!
Lee... uh...
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
And you're in love overnight?
Mm-hm?
They're fantastic.
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
I don't know.
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
Absolutely.
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
Mm-hm.
Elliot lusts after you.
Because I have to!
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
I think they're fantastic.
Why?
Do you miss Frederick?
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Wow!
What are you talking about?
True.
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
It's, uh, you never know--
Oh, he's such a loser!
He's married...
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
Hey, hi!
You're too demanding.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
You're grateful, but you resent me.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
Yes, you do recall, right?
Good.  How are you?
Oh, no.
...in a really horrible way.
So how are you?
Come on.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
You've always hated my taste in the past.
You have.
You're kidding me.
I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
It's a growth business.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
Say it in English.
You want to get married...?
You're ready now.
How crazy is that.
How was America?
He escaped...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
What reaction?
Exactly.
Mmm...
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
...fraid, that's about it, Doctor.
Let the girl go.
Look at this:
I am all attention.
I think its meaning is clear.
You nervous...?
Give it up, Evelda.
A wonderful country...
...should love to correct your error. 
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
I saw a man, somewhat <u>fatigued</u>. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  In the middle of the day.  An old story.  And then I saw the clothing was <u>fresh</u>--therefore:  a man who dressed at <u>home</u>.  And then I remarked the new <u>wedding</u> ring.  And so:  the <u>story</u> gave me pause.  A lovely story.  A new, and a beloved <u>wife</u>.  I wish you joy. 
How so?
I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
Darling...
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
Yes.... yes...
And you let her get away.
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
Show'm the FBI <u>Hand</u>shake...
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
Saying what, "Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
Why?
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
...and that is what you need to expand.
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
Ask me when we get home.
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
<u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
Speaking of the Vacant Post.
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
Yes.
...yes...?
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
Why are you...don't stop...why?
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall. Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little Wendy foreground. Me background. What are the odds on that one?
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
I hope so...
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
You are to be executed at Dawn anyway.  Might as well commit the crime. Go to her, Wichita...
Goodnight, Jasper.
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
You remind me of me when I was...I guess I was never like you. So cute. So questioning.
Yeah. And?
Talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and I would never do anything to...
Yes!  God yes!  I would tell her that I love her!  To not let anyone take away her dreams..!
I-unno...Don't worry, I had everything on the hand memorized.
Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you?
We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?
When were you in Niagara Falls?
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
I'm still on anti-biotics, I really                         ] shouldn't be caffeining...Gosh, I've had a lot of daydreams about losing my virginity. Never one like this. For one, I wasn't a mutant. Secondly, I...What are you thinking?
What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
Sorry Veronica.
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better than my realities, believe me. I'm afraid though it's time to get your butt kicked.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
Something like that. Will you do it?
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
Veronica. Finally. Got a paper of Kurt Kelly's. I need you to forge a hot and horny but realistically low-key note in Kurt's handwriting and we'll slip it into Martha Dumptruck's lunch tray.
Don't tell me. Crest would be stained with loserness.
Crap. So who's this Brad guy I've been set up with? Witty and urbane pre-lawyer or albino accountant?
Is this turnout weak or what? I had <u>at least</u> seventy more people at my funeral.
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
King David.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
Don't talk to me like that.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
Milk and orange juice. Hmmmm. Maybe we could cough a phlegm globber in it or something.
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
Football season's over, Veronica. Kurt and Ram had nothing to offer the school but date-rapes and A.I.D.S. jokes.
We're breaking up. I am out!
You're still not listening! I'm not..
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.
Turn that back on!
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
What's that?
is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
I'm not hungry.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
I'm educating myself!
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
She's terribly hurt . . .
What?
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
I'm stumped.
We startred off to be. She was, I guess I was. I just sort of....butchered up the relationship somehow.  Bad choice of words.
I understand, I think. Other women?
Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
What?
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now?
Where's my wife?
The whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall? She wanted you arrested for harassment. I told her to chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the other way as long as she did you know?
Two.
Last week...
Hey. Can I borrow something?
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
You should give it to someone with only one leg.
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
"The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're telling me you're the A...?
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
Well... I mean... what am I supposed to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle or what?
OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
I... I know that, John...
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
We're piecing together different accounts and...
Said he's not an actor.
He lost a shoe!
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
I didn't ask him.
Safety?
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
No, no, no, no.
That would be stupid.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
So, you're just kind of a roving --
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
'"... or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And inside their new house, the three little pigs just laughed -- '
A man scared me.
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
Here, take this out to the table.
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
What's that?
They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
He made, you know, a remark.
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
Do you remember who gave us this?
Where should I hide the car keys?
Philip!  The senior partner?
His secretary just confirmed.
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.
Oh, honey.
Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
You'll see that there's really much more space than the average three bedroom.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
How large is your brood?
Two -- three if you count the husband.
All right, who ate the last piece of cheesecake?
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
No.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
We don't have any proof of that.
For Chrissake!  Gimme a break.  The guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
Lieutenant.
Central Park.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
I hear you.
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
Maybe myself.
I'm sure they will.
France.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
What worries you?
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
Then take me with you.
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
Then who's Russell Nash?
Do you always walk around with a sword?
You're not an easy person to get to know.
That makes you uncomfortable?
Yes -- it is.
So?
That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
Be careful, Conner.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
We're holding the workers down below.
I don't think it is a duplication.
Is there anything else you need?
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
You should warn them, Sonny.
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
These bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  All we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
It's over.  We have to give up.
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
Talley?
I'll give you these people.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
What the fuck is that?
I don't know.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
How did you get this number?
What do you want?
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
No one's coming.
Mine, too.
I'm not gonna leave you!
Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
What?
Make the pizza.  I want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
Louise?
Go.
What's my name?
What are you people going to do?
Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
What do you want me to do?
Where are my children?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Yes.
You dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
Ten thousand francs for each one.
How many in your family?
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I've heard you have a refugee center at the airport Stadium?
What's happening?
Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
Satellites?
And what will they do with these satellites?
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
Whiskey?
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
Satellite feed.
You fucking see that!
Great, I really need a shower.
That will take time.
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
Do something.
I couldn't help.
They do not have your connections.
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
What!
No, Odette says he's in shock.
What about us?
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
I have a confession. When we met...
Yes.
I want to know.
I have to stay.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
The Diplomat! Tatiana wakens, startled.
Very well. But if this thing gets worse, we must close. If there's anything you need, call anytime.
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
You have taken business class?
What do we do with all these people?
How much beer?
For food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
Not yet.
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Pritchett, is that you?
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs.
What? Deep down inside?
Good point.
What are you looking for?
It's succeeding!
What?
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time!
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
Jesus!
No, no, it's just --
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
Do something!
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
Please! I need your help.
The lockdown thing.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
There is something very not normal going on here!
Blackburn's dead.
Pritchett: what is going on?
For the love of God....please...?
Something....happened --
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
So many unanswered questions.  Why was she buried there.  And who killed her?
I'm sorry.
Can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
Can I do it again tonight?
Maybe it was Colleen...
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
What's he doing daddy?
Why?
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
Who?
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
Maura.
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
She's coming back.  Keep talking!
The rain is letting up.
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
Well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  A standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  That would include myself and an assistant.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
Do you mind if I borrow it?
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne Summerskill?
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
That's great.
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
But I don't know what's going on.
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
Sure.  Why?
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
I don't know.  Maybe.
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
I miss you too.
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
Alex!
"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."
Rio, Alex?  After all they've done to...Hey, these tickets are for Moscow!
"Oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt"
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
Welcome to Rome, sir.
How.
Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date.  No Harvey's Bristol Cream?
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
Whoa.  Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
The Vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed, not explained.
God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
And I'll bring my entourage...
How long were you in?
I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
Have I ever told you the world is beautiful...  I'd really like to play Nintendo with you, or something...
Cat got his tongue?
You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.
You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.
Don't I know you...
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
I'm supposed to fall for that?
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
The Hoopsucker!
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
That smart?!
...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
About seven minutes.
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
Oh, no, really, I --
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
For Pete's sake, Norville!
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
As a three-dollar bill.
You can't print that!
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
My pleasure, sir.
Yeah, but, buddy --
Wuddya mean, buddy?
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
...Yeah, go ahead.
...This'll only take a moment.
Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?
No, sir.
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
Finally.
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
...Enter the dame.
Maybe he's wise.
We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
That's nonsense, Alma.
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
That will mean another interview, won't it?
No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
Is she a doctor?
I went to school in Buffalo.  Paul went to school in England.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
Where do you think you're going?
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
Listen, did I tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and Clement?  Let me tell you.  It's one of the funniest stories --
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
Can't I take it for you?
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
A figure of St. Sebastian.
I'm sorry...
I often do.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
I wouldn't worry too much, Commissioner.  It'll pass.  We've had this sort of thing before.
Well, Jeffries, why come to us about it?  Why don't you go up to the Houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that's what causes all the trouble.
Got a meeting uptown.
Benjie!
Well, gonna make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
I wasn't star--
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben.  What is going to happen with us? Have you --
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
This just isn't the best moment for this.
Damn it, Ben --
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
Talking to me, dad?
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
-- 73
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
You okay?
Yeah. You?
Who?
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
It's not a bother.
Yes.
Forget what?
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
What?
Am I right or am I right?
Awesome sleet and rain.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
How do you know this shit?
Yeah?
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
Why did you -- with Sandy?
I don't know.
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral dilemma. And I was wondering, because I know you're a very moral person, and --
Yeah.
Communist Viet Cong.
One more shot?
That's nice. Are you drunk?
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
I had him!
Guess that's what they call Alaskan hospitality.
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
Do it again.
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
Who was the last one to see her alive?
We're sure it's hers?
No.
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
No way.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
Will...I...
What is it?
Huh?
Stuff.
That's what I said.
My arm!
Who?
She was only seventeen.
I suppose.
Don't you pull that shit with me.
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
This an accident, Walter?
Your lips, they didn't move.
She is.
Where is she? Where's Claudia?
It will grow back again!
You made us what we are, didn't you?
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Stop pestering me then!
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
Claudia! You did that?
You both did it?
Louis, look at me.
Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
That's not so.
What do you mean?
Vampires. We thrive on blood.
Why do you do this Lestat?
My God... to think you... are all I have to learn from...
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
He did it to make you stay with him!
You found nothing?
Lestat escaped the fire!
Yes.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
No.
You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas?
Oh!
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
The shower again?
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
Nah. I'll probably just be here studying for finals. The joys of summer school...  Are you okay?
Just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
You sure it's okay with you?
No, no, no. This was really sweet...
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Oooh, the mainland --
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
You guys lost?
Cool.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
I'm just saying what all of you are thinking. It's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
What is up with that weirdo?
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
That's impossible. I told them Jacks died of a sudden heart attack, probably brought on by over drinking.
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
Your father knew it too. But he was never sure how much was pretense.
What if he is?
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you —- I'll warn them against you.
That your father and I ——
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
I don't really know where Thea comes from. The Vice—Consul at Adrianople brought her to me..
This girl --
You know that sound, Oliver?
There's no one there -— nothing but the caves and the dead.
I've seen men die drunk —- and I've seen men die of the plague.
But the war, the army —— they need you.
What's bothering you, Thea? Is it the General?
Then foreclose!
But they're somebody's children.
Well, I guess they do those things. Well, I trust you had a good year.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
No.
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
No, of course not.
What?
Where's Mary?
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
A boy?
It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
Daddy!
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
What's that?
I'm all right.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
Aw, get going!
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
Okay –– all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
Got a match?
Come on, George, let's hurry.
Hello, George, how are you?
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
All of it?
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Have you notified the police?
Me?
Uh-huh.
Neither am I.
What'd you wish, George?
Come on, tell me.
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
Oh, Mary . . .
Is it snowing?
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
How about that one there?
You can?
I can't wait to get there.
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
Is she responsible for the punch?
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.
If you're beached, why are we doing this?  For practice?
What is it?
Loser sails home alone.
I thought you said she was going with us?
You coming up on him?
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
Positive I.D.?
Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long distance call, very important. Give them my home phone.
Untie that rope.
Okay, not bartending.  Why on the water every day?
You stay here a minute.
Oh, c'mon.
Michael.
Did you get any pictures?
Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
The what?
The whale's mouth?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish....
Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I want to know if a Great White Shark did this.
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
All summer?
That's great.
That you were fired.
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
I'll give notice.
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
That's it?
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Did he raise the Kids?
Can I go swimming?
Is that me?
It killed her.  It ate her.
Waiting for Andy.
Sure.  They like to play.  We may see some today.
Anyone know what time it is?
Maybe it's gone.
Eddie, can we do that?  Can we go skiing?  We can use my Uncle's boat.  Eddie?
What're we going to do in the mean time?
But first, a little juice....
How much longer?
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
What's wrong?
So?  So?
Go on, you're tired.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
I'll need more men to look.
Hope I make it through both.
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Honey, I gotta go.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
I don't like what he does.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
Honey... you all right?
Are you scared?
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
What's that?
I can use a shot of what he's got.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
I have to get out of here.
It's a shark's tooth!
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
Go where?
I thought they were clever.
No, no.  That won't do.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
You look like an orange worm.
Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
She, Mister Hutton.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
Sure.
Musclehead?
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
Sean, do you have herpes?
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Isn't this fun!
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Ahhh, ahhh...
Gotta sneeze.
Don't you dare.
Back, Kelly.  Lean back!
The world's southern most reaches.
Reach for the limit I always say.
Actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
After all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.
That's impossible.
How'd you do in school?
Gee, it's good to see you!
Come on, let's go.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
That bugger moves fast.
But you always let me....
Yes, I did.
No way....
How come it's my responsibility?
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
What the hell are we arguing about?
You knew...?
How could you do that?  Your own daughter....
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
It'll grow on you.
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
You rigged it...You spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
I see what you're doing....
We don't want any....
The fish.  Check it....
I almost forgot....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
Dad died from a heart attack....
Mom, please don't start that again....
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
I don't want to talk about that.
Promise me you'll be all right....
No....
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
I have my own little island.
I could take some time off....
Why?
What do you mean, it'll find her?
You sure you know how to do this.
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Come on, Hoagie....
Let me speak to Ellen....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
Put me down....
Maybe I missed you too....
Stop busting my hump....
Where is everybody?
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
How long have you known Hoagie?
If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
What about Carla's gig?
I live to hear the sound...You all right?
'It was so ugly...It was so big....'
You don't like my voice...?
You told me what?
Here comes the cow ca-ca....
Oh, Jake... 
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
I hope I'm not intruding?
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
Maybe?
You gotta stop smoking ..
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
Where is everyone?
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
Why?
It's not your friend. It keeps you sucking. Remem- ber the old Bum's lungs?
She wasn't lying about the van.
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
Jesus. What are you doin?
You ain't going in alone?
Why did he ask if it was frozen?
What is that?
Yes, Sir, I think they maybe. I think "Jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
Once.
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
Did he get you the job?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
Yes, Sir.
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
John? .. You never said that on the phone? .. What makes you think his name was John?
Do you pray?
It's not possible right now.
I'm going back to the institute.
Why does he want to kill me?
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
When did John divorce?
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
So tonight she confesses?
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
Shut up, King Jay ..
Don't annoy me, Travis.
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
I just heard.
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
He's asleep, right?
I see what you're saying.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Well, take care.
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
Oh my God.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
Don't worry about it, boss.
Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
You don't have to explain.
Same to you.
Right.  I'll come in.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
He's coming over.
That's the girl I love.
Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --
Oh, thank you.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
I'll give it everything.
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
You love me now, don't you?
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
We can still take the offer, Rod.
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
I'm sorry I asked.
Why not --
Beautiful.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
To the pools?
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
You wanted smaller.
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
You said "fuck".
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
You look good.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
No, it's...
He could have died.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
He loves you too.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
How did you know?
Are you out of your mind?  I still have nightmares, my reputation's a joke, my leg is shot -- you think I need more of that?
John . . .
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
No way.
What are they?
I have to find Kelly!
Why did you come here?
So that others would know about this place?
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
Give it more morphine!
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
The door security systems are shutting down.
What now?
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
Once we have control again we - -
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
The fences are electrified, right?
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
Why not?
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Can we chance moving him?
Hola, Juanito
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
You got me.
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
You're sure?!
For today, I guarantee it.
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
What's that?
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
Because everyone knows he's guilty...
So?
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
No. You've told me all I need to know.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
Not guilty by reason of insanity. Case closed.
I don't suppose I can go back to the University and chase young coeds again... pretend this whole thing never happened...
What's that?
-- Merely in the interests of order.
Did you?
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
I do.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
-- I don't know the Musil district.
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
Why were you given notice?
You don't believe that.
I've heard of it happening.
I think you've just escaped for the moment.  Just as I did.  As Eduard did.  As they let us do. But only for the moment.
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
What did she say?
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
-- If an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the District Medical Officer's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
May I ask where your two warders are?
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
Father!
Jack!
I tell you it doesn't exist!
Man Eater!!!
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
Do you always have to repeat?
Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily?  I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? --
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
What is it?
You said that.
Will you let me ask you some questions?
-- Tuscarora --
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
He never told me.
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
How?
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
You're going back?
About what?
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
You were hired to look for Tom.
It's in the report.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
I know Tom Grunemann.
We grew up together. Kids.
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.
What about my orange juice?
Will she pick me up after school?
Mom, I mean dad?
Yeah?
Mom, I mean dad...
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
I want a pizza.
Then eat around it.
I'm sorry...
I don't think so.
Yes?
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
Objection.
Is that really your chair?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought much about it.
What did you do when you were little?
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
So do I.
Objection!  Your honor, counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings.
Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
No.
No.
I don't recall.
What?
I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault.  I keep thinking I could've done something-- stopped it...
You want what?!
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
'Night, Jim.
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
Right.
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
Yeah?
Oh, Christ!
Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January.  That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month.  That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period.  That's it.
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
You heard anything yet?
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
All quiet?
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
I will not approve it.
Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
I have.
And the United Nations? Surely?
With much bloodshed.
Me. First break of day.
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
You could buy them.
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
Ask whatever you will.
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
Where is that?
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
They will take Lhasa next.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
But you will always be here?
She carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. She opened her basket and showed what she had. Heads. Human heads. Only the heads.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
Yes.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
But, I have no experience.
Tell me.
I do.
It is possible, Holiness.
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
And how would you have accomplished this, Ma'am?
Oh, but you <u>have</u>, Ma'am.  You lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  A man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
It seems like we're getting lower.
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
No!
Where is he?!
You ready on shore?
Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
You talk to Bickerman?
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
You think I'm <u>that</u> nuts?
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Did you make anything of the tooth?
Why are you here?  Really.
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
In Maine?
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
Good.  See ya soon.
That's probably good.
Forgive me for trying to be nice.
Who taught you be be a nurse?
I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
<u>No</u>.  I keep getting hit with heads!
What?
You wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
He's mooing.
Y'know, if we didn't live in separate worlds and... 
Seconds.  Three, four.
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
You talk to the married couple?
I told you.  Two days, we'd have to camp.
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
Part of our research--
It has nothing to do with--
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
I need the ID to fly with my gun. The gun belongs in Quantico.
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter?
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
Starling - you've earned back your place in the Academy. We never would've found him without you, and nobody's ever going to forget that. Least of all me.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
"We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect.
Now then. What did Miggs say to you?  "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
I might if I saw the case file. You could get that for me.
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
Who killed your patient?
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
Did he try to?
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
Clarice... you're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying.
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
Yes. I'll tell you.
Dr. Lecter -
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
Time, Pilch! My move.
Well that is to be expected. My father...
What?!
What are you looking at, Mr. Poe?
Told you to stay away from this hell hole!  Why did you disobey me?
There was none!
"Some"?
My God, Alice.
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
He knew the penalty for breaking regulations.  He ought to pay without sending you to beg.
We were headed...
What?!
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
Advance, Sergeant Major!
Shoulder arms!  Present! 
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.
Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
You mind if I take a look at this?
He did.
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
Can you fix it?
No way...
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
It hit me!  Where are they?!
Where's Doc?!
What's wrong with it?
Charge set?
Thank you, Martin.
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
Personal effects...
Still bothering you?
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
It's Sixpack!
Look.  Water.
How far away is she?
What are you going to do to him?
Bigger than DeJesus?  How?
How is he?
What on earth's the matter with you?
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Hardly.
I'll kill him!
A what?
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
Bacon, see what we got.
You want a pint, go to the pub.
There are no others.
There were two old guns there; where are they?
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?
Jesus, I have heard about him.
We gotta get those guns.
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Invitations?
That's it all done, we are off.
Look. Go on, look.
So?
They stole our land--
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
That isn't true.
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
You're testing me?
How's business?
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
I'm not picking it up.
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
You still going to all the home games?
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
No. You?
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
Dad--?
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
Are we going to ever see your father?
Right.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
Seriously, I think we should get married.
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
You joke about it, Sam, but we are in a state of crisis. The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy--to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one--your Daddy understood that. He was like the whatchacallit-- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. He understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
That's right.
Right.
Eladio Cruz.
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
I have some friends who have had a accident--
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
This girl has a child?
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
That kind of talk doesn't help, Sam.
Never heard from him again?
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
Besides my father, I mean.
We have a murder?
Hey, Sam.
You got to be interested in somebody. All you do is work.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
I was too busy.
Nobody's too busy.
I don't mean Fernando.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
Okay? He's not here?
Mom?
You got in late last night.
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Murdered him?
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
Amado.
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
I been working on a few things.
The Republicans?
Yeah.
I didn't want to be going around your back.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
Hell of a spot to put a business.
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
Payne.
Runnin' numbers illegal.
Yeah?
Why?
D'Amour.
Right.
Right.
Please.
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
What is he?
Yes...
You don't?
Are they treating you okay?
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
I can be very persuasive.
So why did you marry him?
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
I told you --
I wasn't.
Crank call.  I'll get the number changed.
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
Bad show last night?
What were you doing up there?
They weren't worth a damn.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
Oh, I've got plenty.
Why'd you come here?
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
What for?  You need to stay busy?
Yeah, I know.
Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
What?
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
Are they all in the business?
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
Is that all?
You didn't try hard enough.
He did something with the ground.
What?
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
What are you doing here?
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Hi again, how's it going?
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
No, you smiled.
But, I'm mean.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
Where'd you grow up?
Working.
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
That's what you said the other night.
Mr. Harris?
Mr. Harris?
Yeah, its really different here.
That's not what I'm talking about.
Hello?
Ok.
Great.
Evelyn Waugh?
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
Uh...sure...I...what?
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
Claire...
What a...jerk!
Yes.
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before.  Satan is not what you think he is.  Satan is not some creature.
You'll do it?
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
How many weeks are you honey/
Peter Kelson?
A narcissist doesn't admit it.  It's the extreme of self-denial.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
So what?
We're going to do this.
He was trying to tell me something.
Maya?  What do you mean?
A lot of good that'll do.
We need all the help we can get.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
You know what?  You can go.
Yeah.
Good of you to stop by.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
There weren't any voices.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
What's this?
How're you doin' today?
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
I hate it.
nothing.
Engaged.
There you go.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
Which one for tomorrow?
The blue.
So you're still breast-feeding?
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
What?
Wait...
What?
I don't wanna see that.
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
Just wanted to say good game.
Thanks.
I know.
What's that?
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything.
A ride home.
Your legs don't look broke.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
What?
I can't be nice to a fan?
Fine, Quincy.
I can't help girls coming up to me.
Yo, where's the "D"?
I won.
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
Who's nobody?
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
Just something I'm trying.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
Who's this guy I always see her around?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
You're out of your mind.
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
Business folks.
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
Yeah.
We still have to go?
Uh, your earring?
How was your game?
Where's your dad?
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
Yeah.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
Did you hear what I said?
ok.
You just move in here?
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
got some coffee brewing, huh?
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
That'd be fine.  So, Claudia, lemme just say, so I can get my role of LAPD officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  I'm not gonna write you up or anything, I'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  They're incovenienced by that.  If you had a job you'd probably understand, but I see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- If it's the middle of the day -- that's what I do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? I see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
If you're not here for a 422 --
Just Jim.
What is it?  Did you forget something?
Eight o'clock?
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
It's my favorite place --
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
I'm sorry.
ok.
I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
Yes.
Claudia.
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
-- can I get you?
What happend, what's going on?
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
No, Son...be quiet...be quiet now...
I - just - thought - that - I - didn't want - I - didn't - I - didn't -
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
No.
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"
I ain't fuckin with you --
Did you listen to me?
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
What?  What does that mean?
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Mmm.Hmm.
I'm sick.
Stay that way.
I don't have any money, Solomon. If you fire me --
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
Do you wanna sit down?
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
Time lines, y'know?  I remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
Yeah.
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
No.
Just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- And Bing-Bam-Boom I'm away on a tangent -- I get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: Because I Am What I Believe. I am what I teach, I do as I say, I live by these rules as religiously as I preach them: And you wanna know what? I'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
-- let's talk more about your background --
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
-- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
And your father?
From '84 to '89.
And "Frank?"
...are you Phil...?
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
How long...you think?
About three weeks ago.
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
Uh. huh.
What does it look like?
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
And what about screaming?
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
Did your wife find out?
No.
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Yeah. Yes.
Will you say my name?
I won't.
What happend to you?
You want her right now?
As fast as I can.
I don't know.  I have to go, I don't have time and I have more drinking to do before I go march --
How do we do this, then?
I'm a bad person.
No.  No.
Rose, I don't --
No one else that I know?
Just once.
Well maybe.
I don't know....
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
I really don't know.
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
....it's alright....
You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
Phone number.
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
They just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
Be ready at two --
Yes.
I have money.
No, M'lady.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
He is your brother!
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
Your Majesty...
The Prison of Belle Sur.
Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
More wine!!
Three days??!!
You grow fond of him.  That's good.
Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
Look at us.  We are old men now.  But once we were young.  And when we saw injustice, we fought it.
I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
Everyone back.
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
What use am I?
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
How did you know -- ?
All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
Are you hungry?
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
Your Majesty has had many women --
Silence!  I order you!
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
It shall be done, your Majesty.
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Majesty... We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week.  If we distributed some of that, we would have time to gather more before --
... Nothing.
Did you know... about Raoul?
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
So what?
You can cut the shit, asshole--
What?
Did you start out area six?
Well don't you think that's odd?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.
Jesus, man...
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
No thanks.  How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
It's not very much to go on...is there anything else we can check?
Are you going to be alright?
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
That's when it happened?
Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea.
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
In thirty-five minutes.
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy...  He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  We can make out: 'six-six-six'.  I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it.
Where?
And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
You said the guy down here is good.
What do you want to do?
I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
I'll pick you up in...
Something Lecktor said.
He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door?
Will...?
I'll take you.
I have work to do at the plant.
Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?
Reba...
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Yes.
Yes.
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
In a holding cell.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
Nine that we know of. Two didn't die.
To yourself...
You mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  You are open and easy now... It took you a lot of work to get to that...
What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
You remember when we first met?  And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong?
Then why?
I came up here after Kevin's father died.  They were very supportive and helped me adjust. I got myself together. I've gotten myself together now, too.
Maybe we should give it some time...
Go on to the house.
My name's Will Graham. I...
Yeah...
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
Yes.
We don't know that.
How?
You went in the apartment?
Did the girl die?
Huh?
That's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
Why should I tell you?
You had disadvantages.
Kevlar Second Chance.
People love... comedians.
George, I hate sitcoms.
No.
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
But wasn't it funny?
You must take a little pleasure in it.
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
My hair is coming out.
Really?
What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
What do you mean?
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
I'm gonna quit.
So?  What do they know?
No!  Andy, don't do it --
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
It is apparently not working.
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
Er, yes.  Speaking.
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
He's gonna make it.
Don't be ridiculous.
Do you?
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
No, it's all right.
How?
I got a fibrillation!
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
What truth?
Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real?
This isn't real?
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
Yeah.
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
She helped you?
Yes I do.
Got it.
Who?
Okay, now I'm supposed to say, 'Hmmm, that's interesting but...' Then you say --
How do you know that name?
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?
Of what?
God...
Are you all right?
What are you doing?
I'm going in after him.
You can't!
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Morning.  Did you sleep?
What are you talking about?
Know where he is?
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
I gotta get the stuff.
Jewish...
So I'll send you a postcard from wherever.  If I get there.
Yeah.
And say what?
Next time, bet with your own kind.
You got some mouth!
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?
I won't wait until Tuesday.  I'll break your arms right now.
That's not going to help.
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
Back so soon.
I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
Michael, give us a lift.
You getting out too?
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
What do they expect you to say?
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
What is it now?
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
You're intolerable today.
Lower the fuckin music--I can't hear nothin.
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
Yeah, it's your father's.
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
Look who's talking.
Who's Annie?
I haven't been the father to you that --
What about the Mayor?
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
What are you eating.
'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Yes.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
'Just kidding'?
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew.  Forgive me.  I want you to know I value your advice.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
Don't you want to hear the details?
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
I'm going to put a stop to this!
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
I from dat nex' place.
Not dis pain.  Dis pain tru an' tru. Make it go 'way.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?
My Doctor Lady?
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
Jennifer.
And you're a nice man, Quince.
Thanks.
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
What are you doing here?
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
I've got plenty of friends.
Yes?
Watch me do what?
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
You're here?
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
Susan --
No --
Well, thank you for letting me know.
And what?
Yes?
I'm not everybody.
What's it like?
What's it like where I'm going?
Yes, I am.  There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor.  Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
Are you going to eat your lunch
Truly - uh - splendid.
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
Okay.  Goodnight.
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
I couldn't sleep.
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
This universe?
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
He is --
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
You are --?
Death!
'...I know, it's none of my business.'
What do you mean?!
Yes what?
I'm doing great.  You ready?
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
We're all here, Bill --
Good morning, Dad.
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
Bravo.
You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
What is it, Daddy --?
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
Then what is it?
Where's Joe?
Where is he?
Are you relieved?
What was that?
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
I've got patients coming in --
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
You said you liked me.
47.
Well, what then?
Just loud enough to wake me up.
You don't know?
My wife.
Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
How long have I been here?
Couple days.
What makes you think he's my friend?
This isn't your room. You're in 304. I Fucked up.
This was your room. You're up in 304 now.
Where'd you get it?
I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
Yeah.
They treating you alright?
I did exactly what you told me. I went to		   * Dodd and I said that I didn't have				* Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
And what did he say?
What are you gonna do?
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
Who?
What does he want?
Neither do I.
Help me.
Don't talk about my wife.
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
They're not looking for him.
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
I'm not appealing the decision.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
Mr Gammell?
Lenny, is that you?
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
You really want to find this guy?
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
You're living.
Natalie? Natalie who?
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
We probably ought to take his car, you know, teach him a lesson.
Shut it, Teddy.
Teddy. Your buddy.
Prove it.
Unfinished business.
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
Why?
No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
You won't remember!
So who are you saying he was?					*
You probably.							 *
And...?
He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die...  Everybody gets it.
Yeah?
Just came in.  She's still alive.
Not anymore.  This is a distribution network out of South Florida, moving poly-drug loads, crystal meth through coke, to Nashville, Atlanta, Memphis, Cleveland.  And computer fraud, identity theft. It's like that.
Make it 35.
What's "nothing"?
Where's that?
I insist.
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
...and therafore there is no consequence?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
What's the best fortune you ever got?
If they attack you...
José...
What...?
You afraid of violence?
Red light, green light, José?
Client got delivery.  But there were..."extras" in the back of the truck.
What'd Neptune tell you?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
What's our deal?
What <u>you</u> get <u>from</u> us is a date.  A place.  "In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami."  At such-and-such time, an eighteen- wheeler will be there.  Keys in the ignition.  Ready to roll.  You pick it up.  And you drive it...  ...away.
You worried about the tree line, US Customs AWACS, or something else on your mind?
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
Then you should.
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
You mean with the flowers...?
What's it say?
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
It's all bullshit.  Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. José knows that...  Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
Then what were we talking to you for?
Lotta rich women back there...
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
You got a comb?
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
You're what?
Thanks, Joe.
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
Ready for anything.
Yeah.
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
What?
No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
Right!  That's what we're shooting for.  Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but right now relations with the Turks aren't too good, Nixon's upset the hell out of them. Our best bet's... right here.
Where'd you get that limp?
Where you staying, Dad?
For the money... )
All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us.  You sure you looking for your friends, man?
No, I'm not afraid.
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
...are you with the Consulate?
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
Best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
What do you mean?
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy!
Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Never was anybody like you...
My passport!
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.
Know what?
Who got the Frenchman out?
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
Weird shit...?
And a right.
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Did you see the size of that thing?!
I only got...
You feel anything?
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
What are you doing down here?
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Honey, just leave it.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
My God.
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
I'm not much of a critic.
What are they...?
Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they?  It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you.
If you wouldn't mind.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
The phones are working?
My daughter must be going nuts.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
Thank you so much.
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again.
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
See, isn't this nice?
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
Here, in case you think of any ideas.
--cliff-hangers--
You can--you have the "gotta"--
Have to wait.
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
No, I haven't.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
Now don't fuss, Paul.
What is it?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
Has she been buying any odd things lately?
No, the typing kind.
No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
That'd be a first.
I thought you were over it.
From her point of view or mine?
I thought you were going to dinner.
On what.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
If it'll make you feel any better, you're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money.
Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
Checkpoint Charlie plus 30, altitude minus two-zero-thousand.  Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
- torque wrench.
At least you walked.
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
Ask a question, you get an answer!..
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
Much.
Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
Where do I meet you?
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
Nyah, you've done more than enough.  Even the best of snake charmers get bit.
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
Twice.
So there's one thing we know Ambrose doesn't.
'Terrorists?'
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
Yes, I believe that's right.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
Krieger can get it.  Right?
What happened to Jim?
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
I didn't say that.
You didn't have to.........
I just need you to be safe.
What about you?
We did what we had to do.
Is this the only way?
Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
What are we downloading?
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
Why don't you come back with me?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
Give me the God damn gum.
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
Higher.
Why?
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
What problem?
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
Not this week. This week he's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish guides.
No, not in a hurry.  What do you think? You think the plot'll work?
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
Why don't you take a look?
Whatís the problem.
Itís not working.
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
I don't wanna talk about it.
Rose, pass the wine.
I have my eyes open.
I don't know what you mean.
Where's Ma?
I'm getting married.
Yeah.
I got it done.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
You don't have to help me.
Loretta.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
I'm a wolf?
Because I have no Luck!
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
Take it easy.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
You don't get along with anybody!
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
What are you talking about?
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
How can you ask me that?
He didn't come!
I'm freezing to death.
Hi Loretta.
How about a month from today?
He's my younger brother.
Have you told her we're getting married?
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
Will you live here?
No.
No more he's not.
No.
Oh.
You should think about this.
Alright.
Don't make yourself sick.
Moving in?
So.
But why would a man need more than one woman?
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
Thanks, comrade.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
I think it's because they fear death.
You mean the whole house?
My God, it's a mansion!
Rita. Rita.
I don't know.
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
I see.  Yes, of course.
No, no,  It floats.   Throw her in the pond Tie weights on her.  To the pond.
Get away!
Through ... We found them.
Not at all.  They could be carried.
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
Who are the Britons?
Well, how did you become king, then?
Thanks you, Knights Who Say Ni!  You are fair and just.  We will return with a shrubbery.
Of course.
Yes ...
What is that?
You're a liar.
Course I have.
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
I'm invincible!
All right, we'll call it a draw.
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
Ni!
Greetings King Arthur.
What?
Too late.
Behind the rabbit?
I'm thirty-seven.
Sorry ...
... Well, we did do the nose.
... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
My name is Sir Launcelot.
To find the Holy Grail.
What is your favorite colour?
I dunno, Must be a king.
Why?
Well taken, Concorde!
I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
Do you want to come and have a drink?
What - the curtains?
But I don't like her.
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
But, Father.
Oh, yes!  we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had to leave and we were with him.
We must examine you.
You've come to rescue me?
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
He's come to rescue me, father.
So?
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
What are you doing?!
You watch your tongue.
Aye.
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
It's a diary.
Checked and locked, sir.
Louder, girl!
Hey, Barney.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
A situation?
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
Mama...
The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
Who'll bring it to me?
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
Do you hunt?
You're injured.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
They don't see it.
The threat.  I tell them, but they don't see it.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
Archie.
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
Those, over there, there.
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
John?
Yes, ma'am?
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
Then they may read about me.
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
You can't know that for sure.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Has he been hurt?
A few days, ma'am.
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
Your Majesty --
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
What do you mean?
You've got your ten levels, right? Here they are...  Each level has an exit, only remember, the exits aren't always what they seem.  First one's The Blood Red Sky, then you've got The Blue Desert, Tower of Ghosts, Kingdom of the Blind...  On each world you have to find a golden key and you've only got so much time to do it in.  If you're too late, The Screamer comes.
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
But how can it change every time?
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
So where is he?
I'm in the middle of it...
It turned itself back on, Nick.
Where to now?
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.
And beat it at it's own game.
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
You're not coming, Alex.
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
You feel it?  It's different this time.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
Okay.  It's West.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
Go for it.
So what do you think?
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
They fired everyone.
No.
I'm going home.
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
One.
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Get going. You don't want to be late.
Yes.
Was anyone hurt?
But it said #12.
What's wrong?
Okay... but just...just to see.
Okay.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
Yes, Sir.
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Yeah, they showed me
Nice wallets.
The one of 'em still alive?
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
How do we get out of this room ?
McCay knows ?
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
I'm not listening.
Not listening !
Do you have something better to talk about ?
You didn't think about it did you ? I read your file. It said you had a nervous breakdown.
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
I thought you made this place ?
An elevator ?
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
Don't.
He'll never get it right. Try the Log Ride !
Stop the hydraulics.
When you are ready.
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
You did.
He probably has a history of this shit.
Fire the whole division. We're moving more of the operations division into Manhattan anyway. Whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed. We already have all the key people here. Anyone else is expendable.
One moment dear... 
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
He must have had a gun stashed. God damn it !
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
Thank you.
As appealing as that sounds...
Good morning.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
What do you remember about her.
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
Hi honey.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
No.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
I told you it was a long story.
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
And she saved it.
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
More than anything in the world.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
Well...
oh.
It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
Is it okay if I drink this?
Then I have come to the right place.
I guess you have.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
This is really very nice of you.
My mother.
Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
I want juice!
MOM!
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
Getting off please.
What difference does it make?
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
I think it's cool.
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
Just give it to me!!
...I dropped it.
What are you doing? You can't go in there!
My mother stood on this very spot.
What do you think?
Well Rose was being very thorough.
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
I should do this myself.
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
Yes, I do.
Well maybe for you.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Why not now?
He's so tiny.
Really?
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
Ex...ex, ex...
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
I think it's still available.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
Kinda like men.
Are you mad at me?
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
Shelly?
Can we see it from the back yard?
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Vada, we're trying to work here.
VADA!
Dad?
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
When??
Feeding my fish.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
I found this.
In the garage.
Oh yes, oh that's great.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
For this class?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
Who's that?
No....
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
Yes it is.
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
Did you read ALL these books?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I'm eleven and a half.
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
Uh huh.
Oh great!
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Well, let's spit on it.
What?
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
I was devastated.
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
Jesus.  You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
Let me rephrase that...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
I was gonna predict that.
Ju...
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
... look good on Kimberly.
I saw the show.
It doesn't say th...
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
Should I whistle down a cab?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
You never eat when you're despondent.
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
... your one chance for true happiness?
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
You got a real good memory, Star.
Then why are you listening to her -
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
Barnett?
I said, I've been real tired.
You going today?
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
What do you really want?
Yes.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
How is that?
They can come to the concert in the park.
What does he want?
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
HI. Look at those flowers. Did you grow those.
Didn't you get?... How are you?
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
Uh huh.
Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.
No.
You got a place to stay?
You in music?
Parts.
Do you carry door handles?
Nash.
Bet the sheets are grey.
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
Well, can you tell me why?
How long have you been with them?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Who is this?
Hello.
Wow!
I knew when I first met you.
Terrific!  Who was that black guy? A friend of yours?
I'm not sure...
Yea.
What?
Oh, no.
What National TV...?
An album.
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
What?
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
You sure do it loud.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
What kind of pies do you have?
When ya had it, did ya like it?
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Who isn't?
So, how do I fit into this scheme?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Whose ratings were higher?
I'm sure we will.
That's indescribable.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Yes.
And a snake-eye glare.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
It's hard to say Capt'n.
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...
You can't be serious?
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Roger?
And where do you keep Mickey?
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
They done that too long in my family.
Want me to come?
All right, you get out of here, man!
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
Want to talk to you.
I know.
Guess I don't.
Thanks.
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Haven't seen you around, have I?
In Birmingham.
Your folks live there?
Yes, aren't you?
That's why you come back, huh?
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
No.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
You jivin' me?
No point fixin' it!
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
Where' you goin'?
We was just leavin', fellows.
A whole lot, Frankie.
See you, Duff.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
What happened?
Plannin' on getting married?
I asked you somethin', boy!
That's right.
How you doin', boy?
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
I said, she's in great shape.
Come back some other time, will you?
Going back, huh?
They'll run you out.
How are you?
I guess I'll rob a bank.
So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.
Come on, Will.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
You hate Raoul?
Omar--
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
What about her?
What you lookin' for, mon?
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
What are you talking about?
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
Jesus Christ, Kid. Nobody's ever cracked Sukura.
Maelcom... Do you think there's a hell for computers?
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
Who got you into this?
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
We got problems topside.
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
How's the ice break?
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
Case... are you okay?
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Why would you want me to kill you?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
You've been calling her name.
How soon is soon enough?
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
I'm going in.
It sounds like you.
Yeah... fine.
I'll be okay.
The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
What?
Leave.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
Who told!
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Okay. That's bad.
Bridgework?
How about this?
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
George! What are you doing here?
Do I want to be crunched?
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Uhh, no.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
It's just for a couple of months.
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
Josie Grossie.
Yes, desperately.
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me?  I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
wasn't even thinking about-
Whoa. Deja Vu.
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
College. Haven't really thought about it.
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
What?
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
<i>                      Jack said we should work together.</i>
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
I know.
Uh-huh.
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
<i>                                          ... You're no fun.</i>
I told you I want that room unpacked.
What are you talking about?
Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think we got such a good deal?  Listen - all old houses have stories.
I'll kill you now.
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
What are you doing here?
That's when she started talking about Fred Krueger.
Who?
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
Any ghosts in here?
Disappointed?
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
Jesse, God - what happened?
Jess?
You're going out?
Can't it wait till morning?
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
You like gymnastics?
Can't be good news coming from you.
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
But nightmares are the common thread?
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
I'm serious.
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
To who?
Then maybe you're ready.
Assuming your mysterious nun in right.
Nancy...
What was that?
There are times when it doesn't offer much comfort.  I've seen you before.  Sister...?
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
I won't allow it.
We're here.
No!
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
Really?
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Oh -- Okay.
Are you busy tonight?
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
If that's all right.
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  To be honest, I don't realize...
This is the place.
I have thought about you.
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Cartwright.
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
No.  What's that?
You have a stunt bottom?
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Can I stay a bit longer?
What?
How do you think I'm doing?
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Okay.
Okay -- well, thank you.  I don't know what it's for.  But thank you anyway.
He wouldn't say.
The movie star?
Bloody hell, this is fun.
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Yes?
Any bit in particular?
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
Right -- want another one?
You haven't slept with her, have you?
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Well?
Any more announcements?
Hello.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
No, 'fraid not.
Spike!
Fabulous.
Bad news.
Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
Would you like to start?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
Yes, ma'am.
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
Yeah, kid?
Ahhh, Billy...
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
Wait a minute...
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
I second the motion!
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
They went that way.
What? What?
What?
What for?
Lobotomy!
And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
You mean you're going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
What's your plan, Mack?
You can come back later!
I don't trust you!
Yeah, Mac?
I wanna see it...
My turn.
Oh, what's that?
I see.
I don't, Doc...
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
'Kay, Mac!
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
Oh, yeah?
How much ya wanna bet?
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
What are they?
That kind of behavior will get you a P.A. rating, my friend.
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
That!
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
Is he in an asylum?
Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
What's mezzaluna?
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
Damon Bradley...
If it's any of your business, yes.
You didn't answer my question.
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
Why not?
He's out by the pool right now.
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
What are you doing here?
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
You aren't?
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Is something the matter?
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
Tonight?
Sure.
Faith, this is my mother.
Oh, hello.
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
Have you seen him with someone?
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
You okay?
Are you sure?
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
A Butterfinger wrapper.
We're saved!
A phone message.  Only--
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
What's that supposed to mean?...
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
You think he misses me at all?
That was a long time ago.
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
Oh my God.  Where?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Faith--
And then what, Faith?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
No.  No, you go ahead.
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
What about Larry?
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
Yeah--
Where is she?
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
It was an emergency.  I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her.  I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
Right now?
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
Working hard?
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped—
Don't say that!
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
I'll get home all right now.
Everybody knew him. He got around.
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were—
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into me—I foxed 'em.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
In a saloon?
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place—they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
Terry!
Why, Terry, who said it was?
You don't believe in anything, do you?
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt— What more do you want?
What I did to Joey.
That—  —word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
Terry, you're bleeding.
Thanks just the same.
Then go ahead— go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a—  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
Am I on my feet...?
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
He wanted to see me again.
What are you going to do?
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
Now don't give me a hard time.
Mind your own business, Father.
This is my business.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
...walk?
Baseball bats— that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
Waterfront— Crime— Commission— ?  What's that?
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
I think you could have.
Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher— hooks— over 'n under—  — whop-whop!
Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?
Some chance at ten percent a week! And if he don't borrow, he don't work.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
I know, Johnny, I know... .
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
A banana boat. It would be bananas.  One of these days me ship's comin' in from Ireland,  God love 'er, loaded to the gunnels with sweet Irish whiskey!
I was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself.  Now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat.
Keep Charley out of this.
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
Something's making that music.
Can't we get out of here?
That sudden?
All right.  Put it on heavy.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
Ahh, there is yet time.
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
Aannnnaahhnn.
I could make her another Cleopatra...
Yes, it is.
Yes.
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
He didn't want me to.
He'd call every once in a while.
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Sure looks that way.
Let's go to Detroit.
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
Call and tell you.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
You want, I tole you you can come. You all right, Foley.  I like you.
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop.  I'm very excited about tonight.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
Boy, it stunk in there.
You don't seem all that scared.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
Is that right?
Really.
You know who this is?
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
Don't leave me.
Love it.
What, as a sales rep?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
You like taking risks.
Whose blood you got all over you?
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Of course not.
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
I don't know.  I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
The flight?
That time?
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Hejira.
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
But you're sure we've met, huh?
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
What's wrong with you?
I'm looking for Maurice.
That's not Maurice?
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
It's beautiful.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
Dad...
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
What are you thinking about?
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
How do I look, mama?
Did you pay the guy the reward?
The woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty-two pistol, and some of his clothes.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Midge.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
Do you always stutter?
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
Where's that lizard?
Yeah.
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
Cock-suckin' right I do!!  In the gun lockers!
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Fuck you.
Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
I'm out of ammo!
No.  You're trying to beat me.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
Sorry to trouble you.
What's your name?
What do you get for winning?
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
Leapin' Jesus!
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
I may be an old fool, but I think we can help you.
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
I don't get it.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Thanks.
Right. I promised my mother.
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
I'm sorry Charlie.
Charlie. About last nights..
What am I going to do with you?
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
Does this mean you like me again?
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
Terry, slow down.
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author — fat, violent, drunk...
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
For everyone.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
Quiet today?
Oh no!
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Isn't that awfully forward?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
What's that?
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
Hey! Where're you off to?
Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie didn't die.
He pissed me off.
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
What do you mean?
I don't know what to do, Bob.
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
Drew!
I'm not going to close the--
Whatever.
I know that, Charles.
Congratulations.
Kids are great.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Continue.
We're friends of Beckett's.
I'm a law suit.
What have you prayed for?
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
What can I do?
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
Really?
That's right.
Where's Dad?
Yes.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Ms. Burton. You're black.
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
Andrew Beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990, is that correct?
Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Sometimes it seems like society is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.
Who?
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct?
Don't wanna miss this.
You came for us....
Probably okay to talk to me now.
Tell me that was you.
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
What're they doing? What're <u>we</u> --
Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
But I just wanted to say --
One or two.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
I promised them we'd go back with more light. And that's exactly what we're gonna do..
What, you're afraid?
There....
Hey.
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
Didn't bite.
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
Let's board this up and get the hell gone. They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
Oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, Johns.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
Hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
Just shut up, okay?
I don't suppose....
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more space 'tween us and them.
The sled as a shield....
SULEIMAN!
A toast to whatever he just said.
What the hell are these?
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
Nice embellishment.
What's her name, anyway?
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
Dear, you're a scientist. Don't you believe your own eyes?
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Hmph.
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
It's no use ... there she goes.
If only we could get a fix.
What is it?
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
Taylor, please --
Wouldn't it more properly be done in your office?
Like you, I find it difficult.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
But the proof? The doll?
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
Says he can't walk.
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 
What?
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Baaa, got no time to go to the movies. Love and Hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Then what do you suggest big shot?
Taylor! Francis!
But what'd she actually do?
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
I'll go with you.
How the fuck you get over here man, you look like you educated...
...you know that night we got hit... I... 
Way out of anything, man. Just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm WILL turn. How many days you short?
What we got here a crusader?
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
What are you talking about! 
He done a year in Japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. Four years he been in the field...
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
I don't know.
Not tonight.
What's the matter?
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
How long would that take?
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
You tried to run away.
Want a spike in it?
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
All right--following me.
Nothing matters.
No percentage in that.
They're going to arrest me.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
Frozen.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
Beer?  Well, all right.
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
That's an evasion and you know it.
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
FLorida?
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
You understand perfectly.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
Mr. Reed would like you to call him.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Name it.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
I stick around and wait for the five hundred.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
I don't.
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
You passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  What toughened you up?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
Got a moment, Inspector?
I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
This make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. The chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
Such as?
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
May you what?
What about me?
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
At first, it doesn't hurt at all. That's shock.  Then it hurts terribly--you wouldn't believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can't remember what pain felt like.  It hasn't taken six months this time.  It hasn't even taken twenty- four hours.  Is that a beastly thing to say?
I'm interested in who handled it.
That leaves two strangers.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Ye have, have ye?
So-so.
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
You ought to know why.
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
What's this?
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
Right.
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
Good.
What did you think of that Wadja film?
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
Again?
Me too.
You don't trust me.
Not yet you know any of these people?
C'mon.  I don't want any Jones about this.
Oh yes.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
Susan and I are very old friends, James.
You're a piece of shit
Hello.
Thanks.
Oh, I see.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
You're so famous now.
We'll see what we can do.
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Friends of yours, huh?
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
I can't do this.
I'm not armed.
I'm not FBI anymore.
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
Kid, get outta the way!!
What do you want?
I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
What are you talking about?
So what'd the other guy look like?
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
What story did you give to Davis?
We're not going.
Any sign of the hostages?
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
What have you got in mind, General.
Georgia.
What?
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
You looking' for some company?
No.
Stolen?
What motel you staying at?
It pays.
What?
Why?
You mean they don't have hookers.
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
By breaking up a company's assets --
The Rex.
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Why not?
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Was someone rude to you?
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Fuck off.
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
I know.  I'm glad.
Did you?
Right.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
My what?
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
I want to.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
Doing what?
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
Go for the bucks.
You sure you won't come with me?
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
Miss Vivian --
Me?
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Are you looking for something in particular?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Would you like to try it on?
Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
Every ship but the four you sent.
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
I fear I'll never see you again.
Singed a bit, were you?
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
You're quick.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
What do I do?
It's you.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
Will this do?
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
Do you want me to go on with this?
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
Sire.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
Your guess is as good as mine --
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
I thought he was with you.
Sorry.
Tell me.
I must know.
Go in, get after her!
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
I smell nothing.
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
You've made your decision then7
You're just stalling now.
-- get back, witch --
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
Enough.  It's better.  Please, Lambchop, it's better.  Stop. You're hurting it again.
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
I have hurt your feelings.
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
You're going to jump on me.
What???
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
Coney Island??
I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks.
Maybe you're happy.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
Leo, what if this play is a hit?
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
No way out.  No way out.
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
You, Blum go Motel.
Finder's keepers.
Oh, the best one.
By the sacred memory...
Nietzche...
People can hear you.
What have you done, LSD?
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
What do you do best?
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
No good, baby, no good.  You heard my orders.  Nobody retreats. Attack!  Attack!
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
Tell me all about her.
The following morning. Sunday.
Anyone at home?
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
I'm in no mood for trouble!
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
Yes.
May I talk to you?
Lila.
What thing?
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
Where... can I stay?
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 
He didn't come back here?
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
I know.  Do you think if something happened, it happened there?
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
Can you?
Am I that close to Fairvale?
No.
What are you running away from?
Why do you ask that?
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
Why don't you go away?
To a private island, like you?
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Then I'm free to go...?
I'm sorry.
Recluse. Kinder word.
Barefaced.
My mother is not dead!
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
Oh, him. He has a cat of his own. But his assistant--he's the cat-hatenest man I ever saw. Goofy, if ya ast me.]
Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
Man, you're crazy. What kind of a place is this?
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
Disappoint me? Why, what do you mean, dear?
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
We'll be coming to the opening.
We have found immortality, you and I. You must not be afraid.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
Charming. More delightful people crippled.
Why the goose pimples? If he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
Well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
Well, I won't work on it from that angle.
And they never proved anything against him.
Or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
On the square, Jimmy, if you'd seen Winton down there -- I'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
I don't remember. Not so very far--
What do you mean police dog?
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Nix, Flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in Dutch.
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
That happens to be the truth.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
Good night, sir.
No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these. 
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
And they are welcome to them. To perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
Have you got it? Is it completed?
What are you laughing at?
You did.
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
Yes?
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Yeah, I'd believe it.
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
You won't die, Rose.
They're dumb things. I got tired of them.
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.
See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
They're discussing it.
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?
Please do.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
I don't care where the polecat studied.
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
How is she?
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Rose, Rose, Rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know I love you? Do I have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? You are beautiful to me, Rose, I've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. And don't you know Mrs. Hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
Got yourself up?
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
You don't know where you're going?
Yes, sir.
You mean a farm?
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
Well, I am working on my thesis.
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Never again, never again...
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float.
What... ?
Sons of bitches!
No offices are gonna be open today.
Okay, we got... one, two... three...  Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
Dean Martin.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
What the... ?!  What was that for?
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
There'll be other chances.
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
You know what I mean.
Slow down.
That's not true.
Alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
How'd we do?
What the hell's his problem?
You cannot escape your destiny.
Yoda spoke of another.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
Where am I?
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Luke!
Someone who loves you.
Han! Chewie?
Lando, grab it!
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
What are you telling them?
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Come on! Come on!
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
We shall double our efforts.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
If that is your destiny.
Yoda, I must know.
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
Janet.
Oh Janet
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
What was that bang?
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
It's just a..a party Janet.
They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
You did right.
On the day I went away.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
...I don't know.
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
...I suppose.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Sharp -- Real nice.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Don't say that.
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
My side.
You're hurtin', man!
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Did ya get the license number?
I don't like ya face.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
What's happenin' here?
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
What about for food an' stuff?
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
Gonna try.
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
Make your teeth yella --
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
Yeah.
The legs must be goin'.
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
How do you mean?
Freak luck for sure.
Really think so?
Ya got heart.
...The guy's great.
Wanna keep goin'?
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
How's Butkus this mornin'?
What?
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
I'm thirty myself.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
Help what?
How ya feelin'?
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
Is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
Oh, a ladies man, huh?
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
This is fifty bucks.  I need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
Hey, Eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
So what's the scam, Eddie?
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
I don't think it's gonna matter. Sorry, pal, I tried.
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Does it hurt?
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Have you got the will?
Take it easy.
Don't worry, Eddie, no one knows I'm here.
Does this help?
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious.  What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Romeo! Romeo!
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
By my head here come the Capulets.
But new struck cuz.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Out--
Of love?
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
Juliet!
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
Amen
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
So thrive my soul--
And so did I.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
I thought all for the best.
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
We kept it...
I don't know.
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
Lose them!
You were a soldier, were you?
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
It's quite satifactory.
Don't do it, Sam!
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
Do you have the material?
Do you have it?
Bad company...
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
We'll die if we stay here!
Then where is it?
What are you doing?
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
And you respect him.
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
Are you sure you won't have a drink?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
Yeah.
I didn't expect that he would.
Created?
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?
What a surprise...
They call me Swede.
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
Cigarette?
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
That's right: there's not hardly enough work these days, nothing that pays the big money, anyhow.  Then along comes this job, paying so much goddamned money I couldn't afford not to take it.  Somebody's paying through the nose for this.
I just wanted to see something.
I came up here to sneak a smoke.
A lot of people died.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
No...I thought I'd take you to the hospital.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
Dark ops?
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
Not very zen of you, huh?  Not so much the modern Samurai after all.
You were behind the door?
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
Give me a cigarette.
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
Gaelic.
You slept with her!
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
Sort of!
Cash and what?
Never heard of it.
What do you mean what are we going to do?
No.  We can't.
We don't know that.
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
We'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  Car went up in the gunfight.
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
Well, we didn't know that at the time.
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
What are you thinking?
He would have done it to us, right?
We had a deal!  What was I, talking to the wall?
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
Well what are we supposed to do?
Here it is.
You don't know if he was really gonna --
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
We got to get out of here.  Do you understand?  We got to get out of here right now!
It's too late...
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Whoa, Earl!
What's that?
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
Yeah I'm fine.
Nothing happened?
That son of a bitch.
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
You're worth every last penny.
Great...
Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
What makes you say that?
I guess we can get started.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Well nothing audible to us.  Maybe the lab can pick something up.
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
We don't know.  Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
Dwayne.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Hello.
Have I seen her?
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
She's not his type.
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?
Dwayne please calm down!
What the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
At least around here it does.
That's great Earl!
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
What the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
And that's how you use the LAPD choke hold.  Now start practicing and don't make me come back here!
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
Who died?
Who?
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
So are you getting on the plane or not?!
It sounds impossible --
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
It's a long story.
Is it hot in here?
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
Fine by me.
We're slowing down.  This must be it.
You've been a good friend, James Carter.
What is Mac out?
Dancing?
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
A little Mu-shu.
Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
Why don't you go get them?
Are you okay?
The police can protect you.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
Lee!  It's him!
Right....
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
Want some?
What?!
What a surprise!
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
How'd what go?
You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
You understand what I'm sayin'?
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
What's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
What are you talking about?
Yes.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
I am so sorry about your men.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
I still have work to do here.
What do you expect me to say to this?
Good one!  Thanks.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
Maggie!
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...
And you are?
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
We think so.
Seven-fifty.
Five hundred.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
Maybe someday.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
Kind of isolated.
Where did you disappear to?
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?
You were not.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
You don't love me, is that it?
Even when you were young?
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
Does it have wheat in it?
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
And then I'll see you in New York --
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
At the top of the Empire State Building --
What was that about up there?
What's with you?
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
What?
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
Destiny takes a hand.
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
Mom!
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
Hi.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
And you're worried about him.
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
No.
Seventy... eight.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
What's tira misu?
You'll see.
Dad, could you close the door?
Write her.
Window.
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Sure.  Looking good.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
Stressed.
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
It was sinking.
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
It's only ten o'clock.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Eventually, in a few months, you'll start seeing women, you'll meet someone.
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
I read an article about this ...
Mornin'.
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
How goes it?
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
They are singing for me.
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Forget it.
We did. It got lost in the shuffle.
A fighter, huh?
They say I am no good to you.
No.
The union don't run my house.  Those Anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you don't see any of them down there.
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
Four nights. How did you sleep?
Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back to the line?
A meeting?
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
Like what?
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
Tú! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
Not even a guess?
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
Yeah.
How?
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Go ahead.
You don't understand.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
That's long enough to get out of town.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.
What happened to your eye?
Miles Davis. "All Blues."
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
You can still work.
He knows where I work.
From day one.  I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
Colette, go.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
You don't say.
Palmdale
I can't tell you.
Can we talk price?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
Hey, I was just trying to ...
You want to do this some other time?
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
What the hell was that? Who told you I was five-0?
You go, boy.
You got a name?
I was getting to it.
What're your taking down?
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
Turns out he's connected.
We know what's going on.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
You mean like the Donner Party?
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
Don't worry about it.
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
Spit it out, Captain.
Alright, I'll give you that. Continue.
That must be four thousand yards.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
Last I knew.
Shut up, will you?
Watching.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
Sorry, sir, fresh out of trucks, how 'bout a '38 Ford Roadster, hard-top, red with black interior.
No white-walls, sir, there's a war on.  NOT THERE, YOU GODDAMNED IDIOT, OVER THERE!  I can't help you, sir.
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
No, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.
That only leaves three.
But, sir...
Captain, what about our deal?
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
Vecchio.
And what about your own hand?
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
And how do you bluff yourself?
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Captain, can I ask you a question?
Sure, Reiben.
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Any further thoughts on the subject?
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Goddamn it!
You set?  Sarge nods.
Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
No, no he's not.
Jesus.  What, I live in a palace, right?  I have guests here.
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
Hi.
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Hello Constance.  It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do?  Can't she come back?  How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen.  I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
That's unlikely.
I'm gonna call her.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
You like it?
Goodnight.
I'm fine.
You're going.
You think you know what this money is?
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
I'm so ashamed dad.
This is me telling you about me.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
Yeah.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Are you busy on Friday?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
So it's an honor?
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
Basic.  Hmmm.
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
Nice one.
Yeah?
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
Won't you see me later?
I'm doing alright.
Am I wrecking my car?
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
Are you comfortable?
You're shaking.
I don't think so.
Okay, what did we just decide?
Yeah you do.
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
You shared it with a dick.
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
What is that?  What are you doing with your hands?  Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
I'm sorry.
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Hi.  Lloyd Dobler, sir.  Pleasure to meet you.
Seriously, Lloyd.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
Lloyd.  Lloyd Dobler, I've got you.
Oh boy.
Mike Cameron, how you doing?
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
Yeah.
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
We're full on bonded.
Later for you, Luke.
Oskar, please -
I'm sorry to hear that.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?
So I'm responsible for the weather?
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
So I'll talk to him about it.
I was just the accountant.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
Yes.
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
I'll talk to you later.
We know that, son.
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
thought he was doing AA.
Don't. Think Bailey.
I'm losing you.
Who is this?
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
Why aren't you there?
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
You know the story, Gale. Man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. Want the exclusive?
No, Gale, I don't have any rights. You made sure of that.
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Finish what my son started.
But you’ll never get away with it.
How do you put up with this Greek shit?
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
I think he's doing Dolly.
Are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of Greek life?
No way.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
He hates Oliver Stone.
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
I never meant to imply...
Not good. How you doin?
What are we looking for?
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
This is all too familiar.
Let's go.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
I don't play games.
Oh--a God complex
No, wait...
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
He tried to kill her first.
I got a surprise for you.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
What about rehearsal?
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
Take it off.
But...
I just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
Look, I'm stuck on the freeway. I think there was some big accident. It could be a little while so I don't want you to start freaking if I don't get there at exactly,  Eight thirty.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Hello.
I don't know.
Asshole, Can't talk.
Really? You're such a talented actor.
What kind of a game?
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
Where are you?
I know every face in here, respect for the unknown actor I suppose, myself included. If you're looking for Maureen Prescott --
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
Excuse me?
What did you know about your mother?
How is that good news?
I told you, I don't know where Sidney is. And even if there was a third killer, Sidney doesn't know about it.
What does this have to do with Sid?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
What Rielly?
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
What about me?
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
Someone stole Sid's file?
What?
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
But you know who she was.
Your life?
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!
Geez.
Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense?
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
But you know my favorite name?
It's Sarah.
Roman that's not the line.
Has there been another goddamn rewrite? How  the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there's a new script every 15 minutes?
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
You're dead!
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
My dad's in the other room.
You know what my dad will do to you?
Jesus, SHIT!
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
It's been a year since she died.
You lost your mom...
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Yes.
What?
Uh-huh.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
Guess.
Yes?
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him...
How do you know his name?
Please don't hurt him.
I wanna play a game.
NOOO!
Don't do this. I can't...
...leave me alone... please...
I'm twenty-five years old, ma'am.
So is Dewey your real name?
Sidney's father?
What is she doing here?
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
What's the plan?
I'm not here to fight.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
And why would she do that?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
I heard screaming.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
I thought everything was checked out.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
Shit, what is he doing here?
I don't know...
If I was wrong Cotton, then he's still out there.
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
What do you think about when you're having sex?
Thank you.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
It's always been like this.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
Where was the girl?
I don't believe it.
What time is it?
Where we headed?
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
Just keep leading the way.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
Same color and texture.
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
Punishing.
We put it in a nice neat pile and file it away, on the slim chance it's ever needed in a courtroom.  It's like collecting diamonds on a desert island.  You keep them just in case you ever get rescued, but it's a pretty big ocean out there.
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
And so what?
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
Are you alright?
Think it through.  If we leave a hole like this, we'll never prosecute.  He'll walk.  We have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
You knew I'd say yes.
What is it?
Don't do this... please...
I need you to look at each one carefully... very carefully.  Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.  Anything at all.
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
It surprises me.  It really does.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
Did the wife confess?
What, Ben?
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
Another one, eh?
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
He cometh forth like a...
What good does that do?
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
If you were tryin' to surround 'em, you sure succeeded.
Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
Yes, sir.
Easy on that!
You want us to fire a shot if...
Why?
Because she's my...my...
That don't make 'em kin...
They'll be back...
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
Don't go takin' that stuff...
It wasn't much of a letter...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
I got to fetch her home...
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Where have you been all day?
During the Middle Ages people were executed at every corner.  What's your point?
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
How did you get me out of there?
No, I've never seen him before.
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
Ah
You have the last act?
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
The title?
Ten pounds.
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
Words, words, words…once, I had the gift…I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones…for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery…but now
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
Very well.
It is all locked safe in here
She is always Aphrodite.
Who wrote that?
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
Go on.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
What is the story?
When the Queen commands it.
Your Majesty.
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
Who is there?
No, the morning rooster woke me.
Let him be damned for his pages!
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
I know how to fight!
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
Virginia?!
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
And her voice? Like lark song?
What's his name?
All right, just a few questions.
What?
Only on expenses.
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
Dig the pit, I don't know.
Is this necessary?
How much?
Doesn't it worry you?
Who?
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
That's because he is. Does that upset you?
What? Uh, no, no, it's a fake. I picked it up in Thailand. The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.
Yes.
Yes.
I thought you stopped going.
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
David?
So what's wrong with that?
No.
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
What?
Stop nagging.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
Who was it?
We have to talk.
David?
It's about me and David.
Don't you ever stop?
I see.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Is this where no one stays?
I've never seen a dead body before.
Two hundred pounds.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
No.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
Sorry?
Exactly what I was --
What guy that died?
You must be Hugo.
Would you like to come in?
I write about it?
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Both, sir.
Is it real?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
Thanks a lot.
Yeah, I think so.
She did?
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
Nummers.
I don't want to place you in any position --
She what?
She's a friend of Jill's.
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
You going to answer it?
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
No.
Are you in love with her?
I guess so.
I do her hair, yeah.
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
Well, are you?
I never get my hair done.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
You are.
Right.
After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying six percent. Six percent. FHA's at eight and a half -- no, we won't be going back to the old days.
Yeah.
I don't know. Probably not.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
It's hot in here.
No! Don't! Please!
It'll ruin everything.
What are you talking about?
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
Mmmm --
Why?
Look about last night --
-- It's Malone's.
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
If I have to touch her again, I'll throw up!
-- please, please forgive me...
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
Well, like what?
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
Please!... that's not like you.
Did you?
Said what!
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
Isn't that bad for it?
You live like a pig.
But...
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
Why, why do you think that is?
Me!
I'll call you back.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
Sid.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
George is going to open a shop.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
You're really a love -- you sure?
-- No. No really.
It must be something.
But you have problems?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
What?
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
Egypt?
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
-- I'll get in the back --
Thank you.
We'll let you know tomorrow.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
How's it going, Doc?
Are you having a good time?
Why don't you want to talk about it?
Yes.
Maybe he showed me something.
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Yeah.
I won't make any noise.
If Jack won't come with us, we'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  That's all there is to it.
Danny?
Where does he go?
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.
Any ideas yet?
Yes.
You went into the room Danny said - to 237?
You mean just leave the hotel?
Why?
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!  Please...
Wendy give me the bat.
Stop swinging the bat.
Give me the bat.
I'll bring back a doctor.
Only in a very general way.
Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?
Right there.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
What's the money for?
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
You want to know what I think?
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
You kids go to bed on time! You've got school tomorrow!
Perhaps.
Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll learn valuable lessons.  And I learned mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  Can I go now?
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
And I'm tearful!
What?
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
Yes, Betty?
Look at that.  Get a gander.
HE'S SO FINE.
Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your heddles.
Pay attention...
I knew that.
I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you think?  They're pretty raw.
Babies
What?  What time is it?
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
She won't?  Why not?
What?
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
My what?
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
It never solves anything.
Mary Clarence, I have given you every opportunity.  To change.  To make a decent life for yourself.
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.
You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
What are you doing here?
I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
He didn't do you a favor.
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
Jesus, what do you think this is -- Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out for you.  You have to hide like you don't even exist.  You have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
What'd she say?
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
Where's who?
Not... totally.
Well?
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
I don't understand.  Where is she?
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.
Many have.
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
Certainly not.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side.
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
What?
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
He drowned.  Anyone could see.
Very few, if any.
Listen to what you say....
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
Are you so superstitious?
These scars.  How did you get them?
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
You made this, and the drawings?
They have done nothing of the sort.
Why would you do such a thing?
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
And this gives worth to butchery?
And, what did he say?
The church.
Can you help?
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
He rides tonight.
Father saw you die.
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
They was a boy. We made friends.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
You know what, by God?
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
You like that Vaughan?
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
You got that shit right.
Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
What's you last name?
How come?
Hey there. I thought I heard somebody on the porch. Wasn't your name Karl?
This is what I call my secret place 'cause I come out here when I feel like bein' by myself. I used to come here with Karen Cross. She's kind of like my girlfriend, or used to be. She says she likes Jerry Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her back 'cause I love her. We used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight. She didn't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause I don't have any money. Well, mama and me, I mean. She seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though. She said she loved me, too. Out here. Settin' right on that stump you're on. See, her daddy's a dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice plant. Was your folks well off?
How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
Yeah, I recollect it.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
You ort not to pull on yourself that away.
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
What you readin'?
It was fun, anyhow.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
You don't want to give away all your books.
I've got a feelin' today.
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
Well, you can't do that. You're a free man. You've been let out to do as you please.
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Mustard's good on 'em to me.
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
I don't think I've ever seen you before.
Did you knock on the door yet?
Listen, before you get very used to staying here, I think you and I need to talk about a few things. Can I take you to lunch?
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
Okay.
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
No thank you.
Is he leaving right this minute?
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
It's my birthday.
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
Will that be cash or charge?
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
And your father? Is he from New York?
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true.  Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
I'd love to.
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
I've never seen anything like it.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
Two, right?
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
It means "happiness."
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
You don't give up, do you?
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
Shit. You should have been married to someone by now. You know, settled down somewhere with a kid or two, a nice steady job.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
I figured he had a right to know.
And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
You going to sit here all day?
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
And have you mended them?
Yeah? Who is it?
Huh?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
So what's the time?
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
Of course. Where else?
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
Where did you get that thing?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
Come on, just a little hint.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Yeah, I picked it up.
And started to run.
Good thinking.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
Yes, please.
Lettuce and tomato?
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
I don't know.
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...
Boat has two batteries.  Lose one you run off the other til morning. Carl musta lost both, so Miyamoto there gave him one a his.
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
You don't believe in God anymore.
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
Did you say more?
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
What for, Sheriff?
And what's that?
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
It is.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
Apparently.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
In your motorcycle example.  Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled <u>against</u> an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
Carl never lied.
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
Why?
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
Of course I am.
We're not?
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
Right.  We have the same blood type...
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
How about that talent?  This is like falling into a tub of butter.
This way, Daphne.
Fight it.
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
With ME?
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
Have I got things to tell you!
Security.
But Joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire!
That's some nerve!
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
Did you hear that?
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
Not you, Sugar.
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
What's that?
His yacht?
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
Well, I'll come back later.
I was it.
You're not sure?
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
Goodbye, Mr. Fielding.
Goodbye?
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
It doesn't matter.
I forgive you.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
It's not the backs that worry me.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
Who are you?
Your face is familiar.
I'm not interested at all.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Oh, yes.  Quite.  You know - Vassar, Bryn Mawr - we're only doing this for a lark.
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
Shell Oil?
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
Have you ever tried American girls?
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
Did you have a nice time?
Gee, I wish I'd been there.
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Come on, Spats - we know you own this joint.  Mozarella is just fronting for you.
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
I cut myself shaving.
I already told you.
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Thanks, Charlie.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
What for?
Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
I don't know what you're talking about.
There’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
I don’t think I can go through with this.
Wow. You look beautiful.
It was such a long time ago.
You’d better get going. My parents will be ‘round to cart you off to the country.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Just because some slag’s been paid for, doesn’t mean you’ve got to...you know.
There’s something about him that’s just a bit odd.
Other than, he’s shagging your exgirlfriend?
Hey.
No, tell me.
That was a long time ago.
Not for a dog.
You’re not even listening.
Who are they?
Not you. You’re not disgusting. You’re lovely. Just the idea that they’d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didn’t...who never.... I mean, someone’s dead.
You shit!
What?!
Are you sure?
Don’t they have a limit at those machines?
But nothing did.
You have had girlfriends?
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
Yeah.
I always wondered what happened with us.
Is he here in Borderdale?
And you say all them people is dead now?
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.
And so you did your job, right?
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
He'll show up one day.
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
I won't go, Daddy! I won't go!
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
You got two shirts on?
No mam -- I looked all over.
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
Can I go day after tomorrow?
Good night, Mama...
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
What's wrong with him, David?
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Mama, when kin me and Earl go to school with David Lee?
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
Where you goin'!?
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
My head hurts.
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
About what?
To free Terrance and Phillip.
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
Okay.
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
Come on, just get to the message board!
You're late, Cartman!
I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.
YOU DO?!
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
Cartman?!
Mph rm rmph!!
Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that way!
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Mkay.
What?
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
Kyle?!
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
Yes I am!
What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
Mrph?
MOM!!!
Be careful, dude.
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
How can they do this?
I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
This is sweet!!
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
How is the children's progress?
Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
What's the matter, Wendy?
You didn't?
I think we're moving.
Oh yeah...
My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
Well I appreciate that.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
And what are they doing now, Mac?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
It's a little late for you to be up.
Well I guess there's no time like the present.  I'll go run a check on that room, just to show we go that extra mile for our guests.
So, are you on for the next one?
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
You better start making sense!
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
Well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation?
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
Supposing we could get out of this room?  Is there anything we could do to reach the bridge?
We could send Mac.  If he can retrieve one suit, we could go back for the other.
I can't let you do that.
Taylor?
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
So what's going to happen to you?
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
What do you mean?  What happened!
Congratulations on your...recent award.
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
Again with the orders from you! You got a Napoleon complex chief, and I'm getting sick of it!
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
Yeah, basement bingo.
Three whips. To go.
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
Bowling used to be so pure, so...All- American. Breeze sings along with Caruso and pretends to conduct.
Buzz Fazeli.
Theo.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
Grace Skinner.
I got a right. You're my father.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
You got a better offer?
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?
You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
Cool!
It depends.
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
Why would you help me?
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
Do you know where they're taking him?
What do you want with my dad?
Business.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
I am a professional man.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
Get out of there!
Hold on --
Norman!
I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it.
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Thank you, Colonel.
Captain.
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
They pressurize us with helium.
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
But sir --
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
Subs are still at surface, sir.
Sir, if the subs haven't left by now...
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
How much damage?
What?
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
So?  What's the problem?
Gimme a report, I want --
A half a mile long?
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
What sub?
I love secrets.
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  Don't jeopardize this.
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
Beth --
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
You went through Edmunds' things?
You bastard.
Beth --
The refridgerator.
Wait a second --
You don't believe me.
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?
I'm feeling better.
That's bullshit.
Don't, Beth.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
It's not safe for you to be either.
Beth, stop it!
C'mon --
You hear that?
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
You're staring at me.
We can refuse to talk.
Fine.  I'm fine.
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
Norman, where are you?
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
Her suit's gone.
Fine.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Her legs are in the way.
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
You mean forget?
What'd you say to him?
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
Arrived?  From where?
What'd you say?
No, they didn't say --
Captain who?
Who's everyone?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.
Check your data banks for all the information you have on Imperial procedures.  Both of you will have to learn...
Is that good or bad?
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
You could put it that way.
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
You mean I generate an energy field?
What do you mean?
What's wrong?  What's happening?
Are you sure you don't need it?
But she is the only link between us and the hidden bases.
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
You're Starkiller?
Yes, sir.
Have you been checked out?
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
Here come six more... grid two!
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
I'd keep that thing close just in case, if I were you... I've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this Force of Others stuff may make for good religion, but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side.
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
What happened?  I'm sorry, sir, I must have taken a bad step...
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
Wanting it doesn't make you the best one for the job.
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
He was our teacher... He was great.
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
You still haven't kissed her yet ? Don't lie.
Please continue, Sergeant.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
Are you alright ?
I'm all ears.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
If we're gonna be a team, why not be a real team ?
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
A funeral.
Yeah.
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
She's flying starships !
Why not ?
Carl can wait.
It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
Isn't it great to be in love ?
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
Report.
A lot can happen in three minutes.
Guess you gotta go.
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
Cover me.
Looks like rain.
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
He was a teacher , kind of a know it all... Always had this little smile.
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Well, of course you should come home immedietly !
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Where is Lt. Ilia?
<U>Why</U>?!
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
Kirk-unit, <U>why</U> do you not disclose information?
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
Hello, Ilia.
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.
Hold station.
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
Clear the bridge, Captain...?
And whatever you sensed out here....
Do <U>not</U> return scan, Mr. Spock! It may be misinterpreted as hostility!
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
They had a pattern to follow...
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral...
I'll be there.
I want to rent this one.
Who?
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
That's true.  You grow up here?
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  But...do you see?
That: in an act of...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Never saw the point of 'em.
I don't drink.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
You can do it.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
What's the scene...
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
How's your star?
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
What am I gonna do?
But it'll stop the movie.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...
Annie:  you stick to the Amateur Theatricals.  This isn't quite the same thing, you see?  This is Big Business, in which, our Life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
Hi!
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
Well, where do they hold court?
What's an Associate Producer credit?
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
...why am I here...?
Uh, <u>look</u>....
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
She's a...
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
Oh.
Will you help me out...?
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
You can't do what?
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
The minute I read that script I said...
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
Why not?
She won't stop crying...
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?
I...
How about that.
Mmmm.  You have children?
He should be put in jail.
I had a witness I would.
What?
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
No, what is it?
So be it.
For what cause?
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
My oh my.
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
We're flying over pigs, we're flying over <u>sheep</u>...
<u>Stop</u>...
That's what I said.
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
I CAN'T PUT A COMPUTER IN A MOVIE SHOT IN 1895...you wanna tell me how I'm gonna' do that?
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
Is that one hell of a kid?
Do something.
I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
Yes, I hear it.
She coulda done better than him.
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
I hate when you say that.
It just slipped out.
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
Annabelle...wake up honey...
Mom?  What's wrong?
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.
What if he's kidnapped?
That's so weak.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
You think this is funny?
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
I hate her.  I really hate her.
There you are!
No they're not.
You do NOT run out on your moth...
You know, this horse smells really bad.
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
That I do.  Always will.
I'm fine, ba...
Mommy, if your real name's Jackie and I call you mommy; and Rachel's real name's Rachel...Then when I see her do I say hi Stepmommy?  And if my name's Ben, how come you don't call me son?
Rache says it's from you.
May I remind you that Duncan has the <u>client</u> arriving at exac...
So we'll...radiate some more?
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
I'm here.
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
Napalm.
Me too.
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
...in.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
Did I hear the word...
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
Small world.
Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
The primo stuff is great for pain.
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
Are we.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
Thanks for coming out.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
You're the hip and fresh.
You ride with Annabelle...
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
For what?
But?  But what?
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
No problem.
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
Maybe he's gay.
What if he is?
Oh.
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Great to be here.
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
I'm still poor.
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
I am sure.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
Yes, Mikey?
Was anyone in my room today?
What are you going to do?
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?
Oh. What happens now?
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
You know he hated my story also.
And you want Scooby to be the focus of all this?
OK.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
...gger.
Fuck me hard!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
I dunno...
Great!
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Anything I might know about?
I do.
Three.
OK. Bye.
I know.
Sure…um…yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Well get someone down there!
--be prepared.
Forget about it.
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
I have a lighter!
How well do you know this place?
Enjoying the tour so far?
She's still alive.
Well?
What do you mean?
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
What!
Can I have a glass of water?
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
What's the meaning of this?
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
I know nothing of the sort!
That's right, fella.
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
General Schmuck?
General Schmuck?
You aren't sure!
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
I didn't speak to him, sir.  But Colonel "Bat" Guano was in command of the Special Service battalion, so I would imagine he did.
Yes, sir.
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
I know that, sir.
I suppose they are, sir.
You're damned right they are.
How much soda, sir.
I'm trying to, sir.
That's close enough, Major.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
And you'd like to see that?
It was a honest mistake, sir.
Why can't you cancel it?
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Have you tried the recall again?
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
A through H is correct.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Just the missiles.
Call them every five miles.
Lieutenant Toejam, are you ready for Bim and Bam?
Primary arming switch.
Some kind of signaling.
Where'd they get you?
I said that's the point!
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
But, look here, Von Klutz.  Won't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked, grief-stricken, and anguished that they will envy the dead, and indeed, not wish to go on living?
Sure, all the time, in Group.
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
Yeah.
Was it okay?
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
No I quit.
Oh.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Pony's coming here to the corner?!
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
No, no.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
Hey, you know me.
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
Wait. Hey, man.
Mm. You know, does he tell you about how, uh, Jeff, Pony, started the band...?
Your his publicist?
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Am I fucking him?
Yes!
Hi.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
You rich?
No, not really. Middle-class.
He is?
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
You cut off your little finger?
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Can you tell me what happened?
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
What? What'd you do?
They let you out?
You lied to me.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
This is my home.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
What about my feelings? What about my fucking feelings? These assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? Well, they don't know shit.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
Please?
"The worst I can do is starve to death." Listen to you.
No, no, no. Y-you know what? Y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
Yes, you asshole.
One!
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
No. No, no, no.
Oh, yeah?
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
You really suck, you know that?
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
The prom. That's funny.
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
Hey, where's Erica?
Pakistani. Okay? We're from Pakistan.
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
I'm moving.
"See what's around you listen to their lies"
If you hit me...
Your manager?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
No car.
Okay, even with all our savings, it's still only six hundred fifty-four.
She thinks you went to the police.
I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
Listen, Kansas, I know you dream of springing your mom some day...
Oh no...
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
My daughter's always dreamed of bein' a cheerleader.  Put her on your squad and I'll give you the guns.
I-I didn't mean to say "whore," Diane. I just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head.
Really...
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.
They could kill you.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
I know - that's what I said too. Anyway, we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank.
What the hell do you want?
I didn't mean to --
Give me your coat.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
Hurt feelings department.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
Thank you.
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
You'll be waiting for me?
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
It's just impossible.
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Who's who?
Second generation, huh?
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
I don't want it now.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
Come on, Joe.
Norma, I want to apologize for not calling you.
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
It's a good script, isn't it?
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
You're a writer, you said.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Who else ?
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Of course it is.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
Where do you live?
There sure is.
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
I've lost my car.
What's wrong with It?
Joe,  you look absolutely divine.  Turn around!
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
I ran into some people I knew.
I think I'll read a little.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
Joseph C. Gillis?
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Frankly, no.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
Paramount studios.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
But what will happen?
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
I don't feel like it right now.
Western Europe.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
Maybe it was just an accident.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
I have to.
Are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Let's talk about us, not her.
But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
I don't love you any more.
That makes it worse.
It's her shadow-self! Her dark side!
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
Do you have any theories about last night?
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
It doesn't seem right.
Balefire on you, Selena!
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
You're wasting your breath.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
A cheap trick.
The Danvers. And two of your little friends.
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
What?
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Not enough vodka in it.
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
All the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the ol' champ here.  Kent, I bet you didn't know I won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
You know what's the problem?
Me??
There's a lot of choices here.
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Well...  Not quite like this.
Name?
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
How do you do that?
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Is this whitemail?
What will it get me?
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
Awright. I got me my electric train, mama. I finally got --  Hey, what y'all doin' up there?!
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
Lots of things...
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
Where's the handle?
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
So?
A normal person.
Come on, let's give it a dry run.
Hostages?
Lois, what are you doing?
Really?
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
I was right. you are Superman.
I didn't think I wanted to.
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
Lois, someday --
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
You do?
Everything on it?
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
Wrong.
Mr. White, the pressroom wants to know how much longer to hold the front page.
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
Sensible enough.
DELETE IN CUTTING
North.
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
No drinks . No movie. This is the last time I take a charter flight.
Put down Lex Luthor !
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Strange. I tore those metal fibers like paper. And what he did . . ..  Was amazing!  Something is happening . . ..
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
You are master of all you survey.
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
No Paris?
It's just a bad flu, really. How did you know . . .
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
Impossible? Why?
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
I think he's kind of cute.
This letter was addressed to Superman care of me.
I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
What's that?
Where's Clark?
Hey! Just remember I made you.
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
Boy, are you gonna get it.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
I am an experiment? I am freako?
Destroy Superman!
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
I'll deal with you later.
Bunkers!
You're a great architect, Albert.
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
Are there any more at home like you?
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
Listen...thank you.
What are you doing here?
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
Criers and complainers! That's what I get! Moaners and groaners! Me, Lex Luthor, who figured out how to live in luxury without ever paying one cent in taxes. Lex Luthor, who built this fantastic kingdom under the sea, so to speak, hidden and undetected by the fools who eke out their miserable lives on the streets above.
Krypton!
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
You're happy, aren't you?
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
Ready?
Your volcano chum? Your junior life-saving buddy?  Let's get high.
Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
This discussion is terminated. The decision of the council is final.  You will cease pursuing this matter. Any attempt by you to continue, to create a climate of fear and panic among the populace, will be deemed an act of insurrection!
Two.
It's a ...baby.
Well - gotta change that tire if were gonna get home.
Folks'll ask question.
But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
....to feel yourself. Very well. You are revealed to the world. But still you must keep your secret identity. First of all, you will need it as an escape valve. You cannot be special twenty-eight hours a day -
Lois, take Kent there and introduce him around
This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Thirty-five.
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
Very much.
Where do you hail from?
Is that real enough for you?
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
Yes, we do know each other.  I'm Alison Jones.
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
I'm...so sorry.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire, would you be likely to sue me if I was to beat you right now?  Beat you so bad that you pissed blood and couldn't walk for a month.  Because that's what I'm about to do.
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
C'mon, you know that won't...
It's natural.
Good night, Billy.
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
Berries.
And what's that?
Did his parents attend to that?
What do you mean?
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
How was it?
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this just now, with you barely home. Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me to fix you something?
No.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?
What's vermin again?
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
What do they do?
How old is she?
Almost three.
Is this it?
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
What for?
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
What is it?
You can't come here.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
Are you a reporter?
Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody likes him.  He's a nasty piece of work.
Before the actual accident?
What do you remember about the accident?
You mean it?
What's so funny?
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
Do you like the colour?
That's too high.  I'll never reach it.
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
Went over to Philly yesterday an' seen the folks...it's nice you send them the fifty a month...
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
...People catch on quick to such an item.  Van Cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet.
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
No, I don't care about you -- you're fantastic.  My whole interest, if it's not too late, is in Susie...and how to undo what you've done to her...
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
Susie, you're very much in my thoughts today.
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
Say hello to Sidney Falco.  Tickle him - he's been a bad boy tonight. He called you my fat friend.
Get Steve back his job...please...
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
Listen with care - this will cost me everything, so you know I'm telling you the truth!
You're incapable of the truth...
- He's got them on him.
That's a question I usually like to ask YOU.  Your secretary phoned.
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
In his apartment -
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
But what?
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
I know you do, Sidney.
I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop.  For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
You going to work all day?
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
What chip?
You have to do what I say?!
Affirmative.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
You mean people?  I don't know.  We just cry. You know.  When it hurts.
Alriight!!  My man!
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
Dyson.
Is it dead?
Will it melt in there?
No!  Don't kill him!
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
You broke my arm!
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
That's right. I was raised very strictly. So don't speak before you are spoken to!
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
I guess you admire musicians.
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
What?
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
Not yet.
Furtwängler's in a different category.
Let Furtwängler go. Please.
Yes.
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Why were they going to arrest you?
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
Steve Arnold...
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
I was warned.
Goering. Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
Von der Null?
That's an outrageous lie!
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
What?
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
How can I know such a thing?
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
Do I know Hans Hinkel?
It's Dr. Furtwängler's baton, which I stole.
One of your people told me.
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
Who's he?
The Miracle Kid.
They said I was dogged?
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Aren't I worth waiting for?
You're a big help.
Pay attention.  The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.  But these are new.  They look human.  Sweat, bad breath, everything.  Very hard to spot.  I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Good field-dressing.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
Kyle?
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
Make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  Now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
Not possible.
He'll find us, won't he?
A girl.  You know.
I bet you're ticklish.
Why?
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
I can help you...
That stuff's two hours cold.
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
Alright... okay...
This is nuts.
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
What are you talking about?
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
It was a gift... from my brother.
Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
It's much easier this way.  Come on, step up...
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
What are you doing here?
Is this you?
Where'd you get this?
Sure.  You alright?  Is this still that contest you're in...
They're watching.
Wha... ?
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
Who is it?
Get us out of here...
What are you doing?
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me...
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
Elizabeth?
For you.
They make your life fun.  Their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
This isn't an escort service?
Like a stroke?
What are you doing?
Yeah, almost...
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
No money, no identification or passport.  You are in a fix.  What did happen to you?
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
What's all this for?
Oh... it's a game.
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
I need the police.
I've been so lonely.
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
Mr. Van Orton... ?
Your brother.  Will you come with me?
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
Look, where is he?!
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
Why are you following me?
What's happened...
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  I want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... I was fully prepared to have you committed to the <u>finest</u> mental-health facility available.  I mean that sincerely, don't thank me.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
And this is my assistant, Mary Lambretta.
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
Hey!  I heard screaming...
All night?
No.
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
What happened after you smelled it?
And then what happened?
Welcome Home.
Nell... please, Nell... take a deep breath...
What'll happen to us, Nell?
How'd I know it was for you?
What's this?  What's this... this picture?
I'm a scientist.  I just conducted an experiment.  Now I have to write it up.
Oh!  You scared me.
Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
Mrs. Dudley.
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
Nell, what happened?
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
It's not a knock.
It's not a compliment.
Like you.
I like the colors.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
What.
Our black friends?
I thought he was in prison, in England.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
We'll find him.
Lookin' good.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
Edward Rama?
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
Boomerang.
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
Steady on.
Again?
Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once.
Probably.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Why did you come here?
How d'you mean?
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
It didn't discourage you, though.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
How far?
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
But I can't be sure.  I don't even know who he is.  He's too insulated.  Too many layers around him.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
Sounds like you need a rest.
Hey.
I got half.
Makin' trouble for someone?
What d'you mean, any happier?
How'd you get in here.
Walked.
Exercising my visitation rights.
Are you finished?
What.
Tell you ...
Yes, Ann?
Hi, Mr Crane.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
...Uh-huh.
I don't understand.
...she can go up there.
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
That right.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
Maybe.
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Congratulations, Gina.
Will anyone else say they knew?
OK. Boy. Jesus!
Coffee, Ed?
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
That was something. I'm Ed Crane.
Yeah.
...You ever wonder about it?
...I'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
OK.
You don't got a headache?
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
Could you come with me please?
...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
Anything missin'?
Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
Sweet Jesus!
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
Yes.
Fifteen... what's next?
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours. All the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs torn to shreds.  It looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
Apparently it's huge.
All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
No, Margo.  This is one problem you can't solve.  You have to stay out of it.  The fact is, I want to retire.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
"Nocturnal.  External hair and bony plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "External mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "Morphological characteristics: Highly robust.  Aggressiveness: extreme."
Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
Yes, I do.
And it snuffled the ground like a dog.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
What?
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
Eats them?
How about lunch?
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
Where did you see it?
That's not what I saw.
When DNA is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can radiation, certain chemicals.  Even cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it out.  I have to get started.  This will take several hours.
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
Hide quickly!
Help someone!
You smell that?
I have to shoot.
I'm sorry to keep you.  How can I help?
One.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
Cue music...
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.
Are we talking Emmies?
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
How can they have a child?
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
That's right.  Lauren.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
Nursery?
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
Your Dad?!
Could be.  Beard looks phony.  It's when I'm unpredictable.  They can't stand that.  That's why we've got to get out of here.  Can you come with me?
What exactly?
Yeah...
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
What's that?
What did you want?
I'm sorry, I'm late.
So why do you want to go?
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
The whole area's being evacuated.
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
What do you do?
You were shot in the head. The bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
You've been back to Dallas?
-- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
Working with?
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
And if it's unsuccessful?
Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
Have you examined them?
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
A transportation system. Transgenic crops. The pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
Scully, I found the bomb.
Where are you, Mulder?
What? What are you talking about?
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
Are you drunk, Mulder?
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
This is where he marked on the map, Scully. Where he says those fossils were unearthed.
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
It may be extraterrestrial.
On whose orders?
I don't know anything about that.
Why don't you go on ahead head and I'll confirm authorization.
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
Is she alive?
I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
About the conspiracy?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
Why are you telling me this?
Where is he?
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
A pocketful of rye...
Did we go sailing?
He hates me.
She adores you.
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
Don't bring it home in this.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about.  Want to come?
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
A child can experience abuse worse than Charlie's.  And grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
Wait...
Little boy?!  That's him!
You sure about this?
I heard Julia and John got married.
Well look at that.
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
Mocky-Lock.
Agent Cole.
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
How is she?
Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
You sure you want to go through with this?
Next time, tell me, okay?
I saw her.  Julia.  Alive.  I saw everything.
Hier sind fruher Fursten ans unt eingeganger. Hier hat sogar ein Metternich verkehrt...
Sit down.
I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
He has a little dog.
...to steal my girl.
It's just what he used to say.
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
Are you going, too?
...is there?
What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
Joseph Harbin...
Where's Harry?
I'm sorry - I don't seem able to understand anything you say. He's alive now this minute - he's doing something.
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt, he can't get away.
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
What the devil?
Getting around, Martins.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
A parrot bit me.
All right, Calloway. You win.
Well, there's not much time.
Who?
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Very popular, sir.
Hello, Harry.
I want to talk to you.
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
And - Anna...
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.
As long as they can use you?
Are you mad?
Vinkel.
Martins.
You remember me? Upstairs...
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
Should I make it all fact?
What's the purpose of your visit here?
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
A shark fin?
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
So?
What's a fascist?
They sound like you.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
What??
What do you think you're doing?
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
Fire...
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
You're not in school? What do you do?
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
Your father??
Do you know it like that? By heart.
No.
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way.
Why not?
What assholes.
It looks a little like a swastika.
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
I thought there were people here....
An investment banking house.
Obviously.
They left an hour ago.  You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on.  How soon can you get back to the city?
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand.
You work for the <i>New York Times</i>. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me.
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
Lina Moebius. And you are...?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
How have things been going?
Fine.
JTS...?
Listen, Danny, you can't just barge in and --
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
So what?
What?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
Does he know?
But your man isn't quite a God!
What kind?
This is a great pleasure.
Have you known him long?
What was he like, when he was little?
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
... It's easy.  You go down.  You come up.  ... Right, Johana?
Because you'd laugh.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
... Not yet.
Lira?
I dove 315 feet!
Great!
People say that?
Your mother?
Madame...
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
What is it?
Anybody can have a bad day!
Yeah... Sure... Is this your first trip to Peru?
I recognize you.
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
I'd better get back now.
How can you tell it's a female?
How are you?
... Not at all.
I didn't dive.
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
Why?
... Are you sure?
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
It's his heartbeat.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
... And those?
Will he understand Spanish?
What's your first move?
So why the long face?
So. Do you have a name?
It's Esther.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
Anything else?
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
Actually, I...I don't. What does that mean?
What are you doing?
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
What should I charge?
Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
They don't say it to me.
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Something black —- something on its way to you ——
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
I mean you being a star and me being just a cigarette girl.
And if you've got cold feet honey, Ill take over for you. That red dress of yours fits just perfect on me.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
Come to look around?
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
Not! I tell you. No!
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
It's better you don't know.
I couldn't rest —- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
Suppose I slip them a few bucks — for the funeral expenses.
The whole town's in a state, Kiki ——doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ——nobody on the streets at night ——
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
When will they be back?
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress’s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
Perhaps it wasn’t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
No. The question now is how long it’s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Laurence!
You lost my money?
When did you get back?
...You-you spoke to him?
Is there anything to understand?
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
I didn’t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
May I ask where you’re from, Mr Lamont?
There’ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, it’s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
We’ve still got the Italian...
Emily...
How much of a hurry are you in?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
“La collectionoose”. It’s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It’s on TV tonight and as I’m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it’s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director’s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
Okay. Recommended...
You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
The £1,000 is on account.
What happens now?
The room’s yours for 24 hours. It’s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Vous êtes Français?
Clients come and go.
Huh. I’d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the clientèle. Get rid of them and we’re out of business.
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Huh... I’m sure there’d be lots of takers.
Five to three. You’re early.
An Austrian.
Evening. Table for one?
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
A private investigator... You’re not Austrian?
What’s a French private investigator doing here?
Do you know Leon’s parents names?
I’ve been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
... No.
J’ai bien peur qu’il te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matinée.
Then why don’t you reach him?
Try again, and this time be polite.
Don’t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, I’d watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The lady’s also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Mossad?
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
The king said you're his finest archer...?
I'll go.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
Will you at least let me stay with you?
We have to press home the attack!
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
Why?
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
Yes, probably... maybe...
No, I... I held it up to...
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
In a village called Domremy.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
What were you doing when the voice came?
Please... may I have it back...
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
You think?
You really think she's been sent... by God?
You will??
Don't worry, Charles.  If God is still with her, she will be victorious.  We're not her judges... we're just spectators.  Let her go to Compiegne, as you let her go to Orleans, and let God decide her fate.
Not exactly.  She wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  Bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, I fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
Yes.
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
What's going on?
Well...?  Shall we go?
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
We... won?!
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I might ask you the same question.
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
What signs?
You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
But you already confessed this morning...
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Why did she have to die?
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
Why are you here, Mr. Wladek?
How long have you been married?
Let me see this.
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
What?
Can you help?
Can you help us?
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
I know.
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
Otherwise what?
should never have come out. I should've stayed there, fought with them.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
So, what's the news?
You're a dirty pig!
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
It's a little cut, nothing.
Out of Warsaw.
I am... I was a pianist.
Where are you hiding?
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
Ohh the tag is broken.
I thought she met your father in Luxemburg.
Ohhh I've never been there. 
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
Yes, I thought that.
You don't want to learn.
He chopped it off
It's my mother's piano.
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
You wanted by the law or somethin'?
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
You got a bag or somethin?
All of it.
What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
What the hell you gonna do with yourself?
Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Which way did he do, Eirie?
Aw come on, it was the only thing to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya back.
Yes sir.
You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
All we need is the bookie setup for now.  We'll worry about the telegraph office later.
You sober?
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
No signs of trouble?
He threatened to kill me.
Then he drove me home.  He tried to put himself away as legit, so I went right into the pitch.
You think he'll show?
You wanta wait for your share?
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
See and raise 1,000.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
But I got a train to make.
But what about all these other people?
All right, I'll give ya a break.  Down that hall there, there's an unmarked door on the left.  Go on in there and wait at the window. I'll take this...  ...in the back and run it through right away.  We'll have you outta there in a couple minutes.
2:00 A.M.
What does this guy want?
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
You sure you wanna start off that big?  Bet like that could put a real dent in us.
Naw, he picked up some jane in the bar.  Can't see him till morning anyway.
Well, what did I tell ya?
Why don't ya then.
You stayin' in or not?
Let me talk to him.
I didn't get the bet down in time.
Do ya know him or don't ya?
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
What about this Rosebreen?
I can't.
And don't ever try to see me again.
Don't.  It's horrible.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Mother!
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
Yes.
Why... in the heart.
She fell down.
She... she fell over backwards.
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
What about the suicide?
He's holding out on you.
Who're you calling?
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
I know he'll turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  You can't think he had anything to do with it, Mr. Guild.  He wasn't the kind of man that....
I see.
Good morning --
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
Thanks, and goodbye.
What do you think?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
But he has nothing to do with it!
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
Hello, baby.
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
Much better, thanks.
What are you drinking?
Where did you get that?
Good. I want to talk to you.
That's jolly.
They were kidding you.
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
Who gave it to you?
Hello... send him up.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Is that another Christmas present?
I don't know.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
Sit down!
No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Nick!
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
Yes!
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
I hope you're well.
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
Home?
Baghdad.
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
A casual one.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
And they can't fly around out there forever.
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
You're the one with all the ideas.
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
I have to answer him.
Knock it off!
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
There might be something in there.
Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
Wh-what do you think--
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
They'll shoot us!
Look at it.  LOOK AT IT!  Shot to hell. It's been leaking gas since the fire fight.  I told you to check for damage.
Just relax.
Stay low.
Think there might be more Iraqis?
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
He's not going to leave us.
Wes might be right about that.
We can't just leave him.
What if he's not?
What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
Yeah.  Well, me too.
Sure.
What do you think our chances are?
Well?
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
With what?  Against how many?
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
Thought you were going to buy a car.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
Some good ones.
What!?
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
If there's gold.  If!
Iraqis.
Yeah!  Yeah!
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
So?
It's got a bottom.
You down?
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
4732...?
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
You've seen enough.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
I don't know.
I've never been under the table before.
No!  Don't go.
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
They don't know.
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
We're leaving.
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
Where is LUH?
What's going on?
I want you for my roommate.
I don't understand. Living....selection is computed. You can't... What have you done to LUH?  She was here..
I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
Hey, that's the guy-
How's the print coming?
Go ahead.
Just do it.
High-grade det cord. This girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
What?
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
Nothing.
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
What do ay say?
Alright!
Thank you.
You touch me again and--
He is!
Vice cop on a homicide?
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
I'll do it.
You know after a shooting I would normally take your badge and weapon, but Glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
Yes, sir.
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
Yes.
And it had diamonds in the back.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
No!
No.
But--
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Just dull.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Yes, Baron.  Moon in champagne.
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
Um-hum!
I've got to see you.
What do you mean?
M'sieu ...
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
Disappointed?
Please.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
Last year? It can't be that long.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
What time is your rendezvous?
But, Lily--
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Well--I am Madame Colet.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
I'll be delighted.
Yes, madame?
Good night. 
I know all your tricks.
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
To me he seems rather nervous.
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
That's true.
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
What could possible be funny?
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
Something serious has happened.
Sure. Count me in.
This should be amusing.
Almost as good as you.
They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
Oy, mate... that was a close shave.
They'll pull us right down I tell ya!
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
Well, here you are.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
Is he your boyfriend?
So don't marry him.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
I'm not going without you.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
I promise.
You think she was really there?
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
You've got lipstick all over you.
Where have you been hiding?
Good-by!
This is Mr.--er--
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
Isn't she attractive?
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
Mighty decent of you, pal.
What are you thinking?
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
But--
Sally--!
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
I could see you were pining away--
How well do you know her?
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Not here--follow me around the shed.
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
A dollar forty.
Not a chance.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Change?
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
<U>Me</U>!
Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
I should say not.
In New York.
O.K.! Send that!
Yes--Me--in person!
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
With your dry wit and humor--
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
Eh?... Oh.
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
How much did you lose?
I went for four.
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
Thanks to me.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Say, "Thanks very much!"
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
I'm all right.
Nothin'.
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
Oh, my God...
He said to turn loose of him.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
That's the rumor.
On three?  You call it.
Very cosmopolitan.
So what does he want?
Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney.  Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome.  You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
You'd die for fun?
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
I hate Sadie.
Always?
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
No really, I can stay a while.
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
Give him some good exercise?  Sure Some stud.  Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em?
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights.  Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
I just got it fixed.
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels.  Want to thank you For that, Wyatt.  All your doin'.
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money.  Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings.  Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Where can I find him?
4:30. It may take me a little longer to wrap things up here.
That hardly makes up for the imposition.  Now, for what I hope will be the very last time - pay attention, 007.  First, computer generated retrograde analysis map. Body here, meteorolog- ical influences here, likely vector- ing of the ship's coordinates here.
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
Is that any way to say hello?
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
What about the uranium?
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
That's reassuring.
She married a hockey player.
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
Have we met?
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
Boyfriend?
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
And what do you call this?
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Wait here.
... How did you get into marine salvage?
Is this - like - a normal day for you?
... What's Harmsway done?
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
I was just getting to the interesting part!
What's wrong?
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
- I told you! He was there! -
Hong Kong, Mr. Bond!
Is the helicopter ready?
Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
Will the cruise set it off?
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
Yes.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
What for?
It is just a regular card.
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
You're always taking his side.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
No, I'm too hot now.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
Just stay in bed and rest.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
How is the garden doing?
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
Boy, I thought you were about to cross the river.
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
That's nice.
I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
None of your business.
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.
Where is Skip?
Yeah!
Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  What would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, Pizza Planet?
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
Mom, have you seen Woody?
Woody!  Buzz!
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
Yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
That's why.  Sid.
Right?  Buddy?
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
What happened to you?
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Great!
Hey, Buzz!!  You're flying!!
Hi!
Miss.  G-6.
Aa-a-a-a-ah! 
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
They're getting bigger.
Buzz.  Buzz Lightyear.  You are not worried, are you?
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
This is ludicrous.
Hey, Slinky?
You'll put your clothes here.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
Somebody couldn't wait until dark.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
What is he planning on telling them?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard.  I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
This place is swept twice a day.  I learned that in Miami in '85.  Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole.  Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here.  And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
Helena --
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
Don't bother.
Carl --
Space for what?  To O.D. like that other kid?  I will not send the message that this type of behavior is okay with her parents.  Because it isn't.  Correct?
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
In school?
How are your grades?
What's that mean?
Ach, that's what I'm talking about. Sarcasm.  Always fucking sarcasm. You're afraid and you think if you admit it people will think you're weak or won't like you --
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
Depends who it's from.
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
You're breaking my heart.
So go shower already.
Yes, sir!
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
I don't think you're going to do that.
Yeah.
Who?
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
You should feel good about this.
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
I got money.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
We sometimes went downtown to score.
He died in a liposuction surgery, right?
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
Well, I've not brought them.
Shag her senseless.
You've stabbed me, man.
Twenty thousand.
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
Jesus.
I'd fucking kill you.
Where's that?
I don't see why not.
Easy for you to say.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
No.
It's Iggy Pop.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
What happened?
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
Oh, really?
Following the game at all?
No, I'm clean.
Now remember --
Right.
Nightmare.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
You don't know, do you?
Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
Fuck you. OK, so Tommy's got the virus. Bad news, big deal. The gig goes on, or hadn't you noticed? Swanney fucks his leg up. Well, tough shit, but it could have been worse.
I got a good price for it. Rents, I need the money.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
What was your price?
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
That's hardly a substitute.
Regret to inform, sir, that your credit limit was reached and breached a long time ago.
How's it going with Gail?
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.
So what's it going to be?
What?
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
Bob?
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
Have the Klingons responded?
No, but you can bet they will.
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
Spock - What are you doing in this neck of the woods?
I regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing El Captain is in no danger of being broken.
Oh, God
Go to sleep, Spock.
Goodnight, Spock.
Not General Korrd.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
It would appear we are too heavy.
Spock.
Spock?
I must have your starship.
Your vision?
Borgus Frat.
For what?
Come on in...
No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
For sure...
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
Flynn?
The Pentagon?
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times, would you?
You wouldn't dare.
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
A User?
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
New guy...
I'm shocked.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
Where are you going?
You seem fine now.
And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the					* ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front.
Faisil.  You're new on Harry's team, aren't you?
Why?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
What a team.  See you at eight.
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Any minute now.
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
Uh huh.  Okay.
Uh huh.
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
What did you need?
What?
Yes.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
What were you doing there?
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
Is it working yet?
I don't take those assignments.
Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
What is it?
Do you still love me?
If we're on an island, why are they using trucks?
What?
Who's your little friend?
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
You'll call me then?
I don't know.  I have to think...
Helen.
It's a good thing you pay me well.
Find out who this Renquist it.
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
Hello, Alabama.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Tell him we gotta go.
The letter I sent.
Tell him to look through it.
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
Want some Goobers?
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Great movie. Action-packed!
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
I took a cab.
Sure. Why not?
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
What do you do?
I don't remember.
Very much. Now, where were we?
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
Is he black?
What did he do to Arlene?
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
I don't believe so.
Where you goin', honey?
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
You don't know him -
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
How come?
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
Yeah.
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
Where the fuck is that bitch?
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
Clarence?
I'm a married man.
Clarence sent a letter?
Money problems?
You goin' out?
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
Tell me.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
Elliot.
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
Clarence.
What the fuck did you bring that for.
In case.
No. But thanks.
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there.  He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Say it, goddamn it!
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
Why does he trust you?
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
You got it all worked out, don't you?
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy.  I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.  He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Sorta room-mates?
Yes.
No.
I didn't mean -
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
No.
A jail?  Prison?
It's so clean.  No germs.
This is April, right?
It's just a shot to calm you.
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
Give me the gun.
...I had a dream about...something like that.
It's a Carpet Cleaning Company...
Why are we doing this?
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
Wooooo, they really dosed you, bro. Major load!  Listen up -- try and get it together.  Focus!  Focus!  The plan! Remember?  I did my part.
What...???
I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
It will.
I got more brains than you've got teeth.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
How much time?
How much?
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
You've been there?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
No charge.
I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
What you want?
We ain't got no Beck's.
Let me get your change.
Yes.  Yes it is.
Taking a little trip?
Who was that on the phone?
You didn't hear something?
Jake, what is that?
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
I got it.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
What?
Like they're made of polyester.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
How far is it to California?
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
I can't.
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
John?  John where are you going?
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
I wanted to talk.
There is no us, remember?
Because I know you're full of shit.
Let's go in the bedroom.
You got a suitcase?
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
What?
You killed him!
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?
He was going to--
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?
But I want to say with you,
Where the hell am I going to go?
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
I . . I was helping your wife.  I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
A lot that means.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
No.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
You didn't kill her?
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
Darrell giving you problems?
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
You're fucked.
John, what a surprise.  I expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
No police.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Who the hell are you?
You've got to be--
Like you don't know.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
And what does that make you?
Next time you'll do just fine.
That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
I came for Grace.
Come on, Jake --
What?
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Darrell--
How much time?
Accident.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Hundred-fifty.
Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You believe that?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What?
Look, Harlin.
What you want?
Eh?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
I call the sheriff.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
I'm just going to my car?
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
It's Grace.
What happened to your hand?
Wasn't nothing.
Thank you, Bobby.
Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package?
Still playing?
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
No.
Try me.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
So, aren't you going to ask me?
Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
Can you make it back up?
<u>Jake</u>...
Where ya goin'?
No, sir. I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right?
They look nice.
They look nice.
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Help me, Grace, help...
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
Once again please?
What did I say?
Okay.
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
Quick.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
Yeah?
How much is it?
All of it.
Don't be scared.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
Against a window.
Did you get up from your seat?
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
How so?
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
Rain's coming.
He give 'em names?
Oh. How long I been here?
I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.
Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
But... if he doesn't miss?
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
William Munny, yeah.
Maybe I ain't.
Schofield? You from Schofield?
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
Been gone near three years now.
You're goin' back with him?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
You still think he's in there?
I thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
You're marking us, Bill.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.
The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
Did I what?
No... I meant...
K-k-kill somebody?
Who said that?
How many you killed, Kid?
Just like that?
What was the money for?
Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;It was smaller than that. Sharper.&gt;&gt;
I'11 have this thing in front of a grand jury by Monday.
Goddamnit.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
I hope I didn't disturb you.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight?
Roger really. People say I talk too much.
Don't hurt me.
I was out of line.
You know damn well, dead-man.
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
I'11 find him.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
Oh, but it's not. If I hadn't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, I never would have took off for New York. I never would have met Keaton, see. That barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
Then what?
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
Why lie about everything else, then?
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
How good's your intelligence?
It looks that way.
Yes.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
Thank you.  When Debby...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
Orthopedics?
I know of him.
Through, through his book.
I'm on the staff of...
Objection!  This is ri...expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
No further questions.
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
I wouldn't do it.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes.
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
That's not my handwriting.
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
I am seventy-four years old.
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Dr. Thompson...?
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
Thank you ...
I'm Joe Galvin, I'm representing Deborah Ann Kaye, case against St. Catherine Laboure.
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
And ask me what?
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
Thank you for seeing me.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.'  'Cause I know who you were.  You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are.  I know who you are.
How come you're calling me from...?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
The TV didn't work.
And what are you?  A cop?
I'm a lawyer.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?
Is this a bad time.
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
Do you want me to go...?
You're going to stay here...?
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
Thank you.
Hi, Mickey ...
Uh ...
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
John:  gimme a cuesta-ray.
Oh shit, what's today?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
What happened, Joey...?
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
The broad has disappeared...
What are you doing in New York...?
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
... I understand ...
Hi.
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Yes.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes, that's correct.
...of the procedures...
As I've said we had some more...
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
He won't talk.
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Nothing.
My name is John Ferguson, and --
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
I told you! Right here!
Tomorrow night? Well --
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
Where are you going?
Scottie, why are we here?
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
Take me away...
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
Scottie, please...!
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
When?
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
What are you thinking?
No!... No!
What?!
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
No, don't go away!
Where's your husband?
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
And it's a all real.
Madeleine --
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Would you please go and look?
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
What do you mean?
It wasn't your fault.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Well?
I think I can lick it.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Did you need it?
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
How soon can it be altered?
What?
What do you think you are doing?
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
Just stop.
So I didn't fucking do it!
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
What about the blood?
We've already done this.
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
Later.
We'll be ready Adam.
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
My god.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
She's still working?
But not tonight.
Oh, Jesus...call the police.
Shut up Boyd.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
Boyd...What have we done?
I don't know! I just want to get married.
What you just said. Say it again.
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Okay fine.
Not a prayer.
Your ideas never work out.
I don't hate women.
False.
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Easy Micheal.
Okay Micheal, let's go.  Upsy daisy big guy.
How about my Fatburger?
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
Government cutbacks.
You can't play around with these tent people.
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
What?
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
I wouldn't know.
Right before the wedding?
He is.
Charles Moore for instants.
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
He's weird. And I expect more from you.
That's absurd.
Do you love me?
Keith do not trivialize this.
Go down where?
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
Will you please call the chair people?
Hello.
Hey. It's me.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
Everything's OK. Just some more preparations.
I won't even discuss it.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
Do you love me?
Who's dead?
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
Move the bodies.
No...
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
Go for it.
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
What is it?
Boyd...I don't know man...It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing...you're all fucked-up in the head.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
I have no idea.
What song?
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.
Give them to Refugio.
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
Don Amalio!
Enedina and Paco ...
What about them?
Which couch?
Was that difficult to get?
You have no feelings toward ...
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
You must think I am a monster.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
You must think I'm mad.
If you only knew ... When I was young I was full of idealism. I wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. But as soon as I tried to do something about it, I became afraid that I would be laughed at and I felt like a fool ... and so I went back into my shell.
Wasn't that cowardice?
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
What will the lady say?
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
It's very good.
You see how much you like her?
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
What are you doing here? Get out.
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?
I had so many things to think about!
When you are, miss.
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
Hello.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
You mean a nano—tech synthetic organism.
I've seen worse.
She saved your life, Parker. She didn't have to, but she did.
... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twenty—four citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
What's the assignment?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
Think you can do it?
What did you find out?
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
HEY!!!
You need a maid.
Talk so I can understand.
How can I ever thank—you for bringing me back to life a second time, Daryl?
A little less than yesterday.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
I don't need a baby—sitter.
He was re—enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
What happened when he was 17?
Checking my pulse. It's elevated.  You enjoy frightening me, don't you?
I've been in prison, remember?
I am impressed.
Who said that?
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Don't worry about it, all right?
Don't get out of the car.
What's the problem?
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Find out anything?
The symphony of collision...
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you——
Thank-you, Daryl.  You had me going for quite a while there, sport.
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
What can it hurt.
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because...
...The Albanian Campaign...
Yeeaahhh...  Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
You can't tell this story.  He's not kidding you.  You can't tell this story.  <u>You</u> knew that.  The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...
All I need is the one day.
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
Tell me again.
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
The American "people"?
...you want us to go to War...
Why?
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
The Hostages...?
...hell of a price for the country to pay.
No rain.
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
None of these are ours.  <u>None</u> of em are ours....  ....that's <u>real politik</u>, Buddy.
No.  No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"... 
What about him?
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
And I take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, I admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that I would like my lawyer present.
OVER A SLEEPING BREAN, STRETCHED OUT ON A POOLCHAIR, GRACE, THE SECRETARY, COMES OUT ON TO THE POOL AREA, HOLDING THE SHOT OF A SMALL, FOREIGN LOOKING CHILD, IN FRONT OF A PILE OF RUBBLE. SHE SHOWS IT TO MOSS.
We're locked into Albania.
Hello...?
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
Why do people go to war?
Where'd you go to school, Kid.  Wellesly?
What one has to do, Mr. Moss.  Is to fight a holding action.
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
It's not "war."  It is a <u>Pageant</u>.  It's a <u>Pageant</u>... Like the Oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
Yes.  Indeed I did. 
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
...who is this guy...?
"Back End" ... count on it.
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
Get on your feet, boy.
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
...but...
They'll be here in ten minutes.
Watch me.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
...I meant the Leopard Skin...
Public Domain.
It's tough to rhyme.
Jim Belushi...?
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?
Oh, hell...
No, I think..
...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?
...got tickets for the Knicks tonight. Go out and cruise some bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?
...leave me alone willya. Only thing makes me feel good anymore. Spaghetti. She makes lousy spaghetti...
He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it.
It's in the bible, see. You better go buy him a present. Please, Natalie. Let me give him the gift; Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
So, where are we going?
Rising profits...strong balance sheets, good earnings per share.
Nah, she asked the wrong question.
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
Oh no, no...
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
What? How do you know about my father?
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
Gordon.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
I don't.
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
How you doing Buddy?
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
I thought this was an informal meeting. What's he doing here?
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
But?
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?
Thank you
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
Two of your friends left earlier MARK Uh huh.
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
Well, it all started when a friend and I
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
Yes?
That was very good.
No, he wouldn't.
No.  But once I heard...
Fireball?
Do you?
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
I'm sorry?
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Yes?
She isn't here.
I don't know.
Hello?
No, I don't.
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
You should have heard her play.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
Thanks, but I'm fine.
Know what I think?
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone.  A blond.  I only caught a glimpse. She was young.  I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
Did he say that?
I don't know...
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
In the house.  I was scared.
I think so.  Maybe.
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
I'm so sorry.
That's just mean.  Oh.  Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
It's a flare.
She was lonely, I talked to her.  Norman, I know how it looks, but--
You know what I've got at stake with this paper.  You know that.  I can't help but think that you're doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
Claire--
Leave her out of this!
We don't know that for sure.
What?
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
What?
:Would you stop it!
Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
Thank you for this honor, my dear.
Two what...?
I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
I beg your par---
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
To love, you must be able to feel.
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
If that were true, I would not be here.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
What is wrong...?
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
Why don't you let at do that...?
Stop it.
We're quite a pair, you and I.
You know...?
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
Their what...?
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
Is he - is he gonna die...?
A bit much.    Lucas.
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
I can't.
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
I'm sorry - I didn't think
Sounds good - thank you
CHIC MAGAZINE?
It doesn't mention 'females only'
Do you take sugar?
And how many people have you killed?
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
What didn't you like about her?
What's wrong with you?
What's this all about?
I'm really very sorry - I was banking on this coming through, because it's only five minutes from my surgery...
Sugar?
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Well. The prom's coming up.
Yeah?
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
Well?
God, you are so hot.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Whatever helps you cope.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
Sorry I--
Watch your tone, mister.
Shut your pie hole, Jimmy.
Hmmm?
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
If you could just sign right there.
That's just one example. My reporting has made a difference.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
Funny you should say "peachy."
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
He phoned it in.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
It's incredibly simple.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
I never figured you for a pimp.
Rules are rules.
I'm warning you.
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
I do?
You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
You think we should be more open minded?
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
In a hurry, are we?
My parents? What do you mean?
Talk to me Artie.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
Merritt, Forensics.
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
And the child...
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
The skinny brunette.
Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
You could say that.
Where's the body?
Where's Lombardo?
Did he come in with you?
He did say something.
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
What did you do then?
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
You are.
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
From now on, if we're seen together, it's got to be accidental.  I thought that was understood...
I'm here.
I'm really serious.  That cop, he keeps watching me.
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead.  Stay in the guest house.  Skip the graduation parties.  You'll never see Duquette.  Okay?  I love you.
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
No.
You, Kelly, Sam.
Davy.
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
What's wrong?
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
Jim West.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
That's a lot of butler.
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
You might have mentioned you had that.
Thank you.
This is good.
No record of him.
Relax.  We're almost there.
And people are actually fooled by that?
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
It was in your book.
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Your guests, ma'am?
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
The U.S. is my jurisdiction.
I've even printed my own currency.
Easy now.
This is something.
Well?
They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
I always knew you'd end up in a crow's cage.
Willow Ufgood.
You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
I do what I'm told.
We're a tiny version of all that?
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
You be careful.  I'm a powerful sorcerer.  I could turn you into a toad just like that.
You hear trouble.
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk!  You slime!  When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Who?
Want me to carry Elora?
You must learn magic.
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
But what am I gonna transform??
Oooh, this smells terrible.
Get back here, Rool!
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
She's hungry.
Its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Where's Timmy and Buck?
That's none of your goddamn business! So keep your goddamn holier-than- thou mouth shut!  Anyway, they like Fred.
I came to see Rachel Lapp.
No pistol. Ever.
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Hey, Sam...
What are you going to do?
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
Who else knows?
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
No you're not –  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
Home.
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
I can't.
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Tell him his tea stinks.
Enjoying your reading?
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Hochmut?
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
We had some lemonade and he left.
I know.
You're so sure of that?
Aren't you? After today?
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
It's me.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Say again?
You admit you're lying?
Yes.
You didn't have to...
No? Why not?
Who was that man?
No...
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
What about Carter?
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
You might have killed him!
I don't want to stay here.
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
If any!
Our echo.
...have you come back?
... -- Oz -- has spoken!
I don't believe you!
I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
How did you guess?
Yes --
Aw, come, come, come --
Oh --
...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
Oil can.....Oil can....
...Oh, did that hurt?
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
Um-hmm.
Um-hmm.
Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Leave her alone!
Come on -- I've got another idea.
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
Mr. Gale!
...of the West.
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
...to Dorothy!
You put up a great fight, Lion.
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
Well, I --
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
What kind of bikes did you ride?
I love Christmas in Turkey.
It’s just a scratch.
...yes?...
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
Who did you get it from?
Your last chance. Take the money.
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
Revenge isn’t so hard to fathom. What’s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
I’m sorry.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don’t want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  I’m not sure he knew that.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
How long has he been with you?
The killer doesn’t want to see this pipeline continue, doesn’t want to see you take over...
The way I acted, in the snow...you must think I’m a coward.
James...
He used your exact words.
Was this all about the oil?
Valentin Zukovsky.
Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat’s nest.
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
What?
I’ll send someone out.
Perhaps this isn’t the time...
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
The parcel’s in the post.
Walter --
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
Mm hmm.
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me once?
But you knew that I'd -- die.
You're the only human being I care for.
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.  Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.
What if you¹re wrong??
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Maybe not, but why take chances?
His what?
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
What's he doing?
Dan -- what do we do now?
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --
What happened?
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.
Who the hell are you?
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over.
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad.
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
Yorgi asked me to.
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
We'll have to go after them.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
Where'd the damn truck go?!
You can't talk to it?
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
What...?
Why you dogging me up?
Help me with this guy.
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
We seen all your shit! So you want cars? We get whatever cars you need. What are you looking for?
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
I wish I could go.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
You should always work with a spotter.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
Where am I?
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
I'll never understand your regard for them, Charles.
Is that so?
It does indeed, Max.
What was your grandfather's name?
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
Herr Falkstein! You have your instructions!
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Love me oodles and oodles?
Yes.
And your passport?
Promise??
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
I hope you like large weddings.
Does that mean you love me?
Darling!
Ready, darling?
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Are you suggesting I call him master???
I suppose you're right.
Will there be anything else?
I didn't do that.
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
Fron kon steen!
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Just putting up some tea.
What is this place?
How?
And he wrote seventeen cookbooks.
If you like -- just hurry!
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
What?
Cold!  Cold and dead!
What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.
Thanks...for all your help.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
Come on, big fellow!
May I see your violin?
Are you busy?
Inga, wake up!
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
A god?
Yes!
This is not the finals -- just sing!
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
Yes, I will.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Three minutes to go!
What d'ya want to do to kill time?

1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Lighting COGHILL' 5 cigar: Our good Colonel Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.
I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
