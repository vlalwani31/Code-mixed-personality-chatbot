Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
That's because it's such a nice one.
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
You're welcome.
What?
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Get out!
How many people go here?
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Why not?
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Dead at forty-one.
No, I ' m not.
Yeah -- we'll see.
What do you think?
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I'm on it
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Seven-thirty?

Why 're you doing this?
You don't care if I die
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
BIANCA
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
Unwelcome.
So what did I have an effect on ?
The duck?
What?
You know what I mean
What?
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
Is that right?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Enough!
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
Kat a fan, too?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
You're not helping.
That ' s what I thought
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
We'll all go crazy...
If they agree to follow me, yes.
No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
You don't usually ask.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
Why?
How did you manage it?
Passion is something one cannot control!
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
Surely you can do anything you want.
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
And what do you think Mendez?
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You tell that to them!
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
And who would you think of, for such a task?
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Divorced.
Yeah.  This way.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
What about back home?
No.
What are you asking me?
I know.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
In the kitchen.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
But Chief?  Over this??
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
Watch the news?
Pretty.
This has nothing to do with your fire.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
Is that all there is?
Yeah.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
What do you want?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Alright.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
You're ruthless.
Well, that's great.
See you later.  Good luck.
That's unique.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
You'll be my first.
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Is there a problem?
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Why not?
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
How did you start the fire this time?
He knew all along.
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
Not good.
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
What's up?
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
You're kidding.
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
He's got a point.
I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
Well, what is it?
Well, how's it going back there?
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Fine.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Opening pod bay doors.
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
How about chargin' the battery?
Whaddya mean, buy?
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
That's never been one of my problems.
Must be billy's girl.
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
No way...
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
How did they get away?
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
So do you...been a long day.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I still don't think it's loaded.
What'd you do?
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Call me later.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Guess people ought to know who I am...
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
That's no bull.
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Can't complain.
We got a lot to talk about.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
Five.  On credit.
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
I brought the girl remember?
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
She's an exception..
That's what I thought.
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Perfect.
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
Who?
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
I was talking to the cat.
How many points you got left on your license?
Uh... at least fifty.
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
Yes ma..
All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
Not without Leeloo.
I've had enough good news for today
I'm not going.
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
Oh, yes you will...
Oh god!
All 900.
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
You noticed..
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Only too well... here you must be parched..
I'm not at the hotel!
How's our deal coming along?
I understand.
I know.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
You don't understand...
You're killing me...
Bullshit.
I'm telling you...
I promised him to Machine.
A fellow investor.
I want to watch you work.
Sure.
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Move it, dirtbag... !
Leave him alone.
I figured you share information.
I'm not so sure about this.
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Any good?
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Who is Machine?
Stop talking.
You got absolute zero.
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
Fuck you!
Shut your mouth and drive!
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
You'll get it when we get there.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Sounds good, pops.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
I'm a working stiff, pops.
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
I try to be.
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
No.
You don't have any other choice.
Nothing remotely like this.
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
My husband never dealt with money personally, certainly not cash.
I'm here.
You told me to look, so I looked.
Nothing more than a bother.  Have you any news for me?
I don't understand, who are... ?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
It got to be too much for him.
I didn't mean to...
Are you religious?
Do you think the police did a good job?
What am I supposed to do?  Forget her?  Time heals all wounds, right?  She's all I think about, and I've learned to live with that.  But, you want the truth... the real truth? If I had a choice... if I had to choose, between her being out there, living a good life and being happy, and me not knowing; never finding out what happened to her...  ... or her being dead and me knowing...  I'd choose to know.
What... ?
Okay.  Fine.
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
I can't find him.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Is there something we can do?
You just feel sorry for me.
Something's wrong here.  It feels like...
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
You don't get it, he's after me...
Don't worry, honey
Been having bad dreams.
Oh...I'm sure that's not true.  I'll bet she's very worried about you.  I would be.
Since when are you such a smart shopper?
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
But I've seen her grave.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Mark...
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
I don't know.
Reef and I can take the Explorer down, clamp it around the eye, and ---
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
Oh it does???
Why do you say that?
Wonderful!
I met Dr. Kent, once.
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
After torpedo room:  Report!
Why?
Or, perhaps, until he gets us?
Who?
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
How soon?
This spring.
Yes.
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing was just my getting back at her. I'm not as dumb as I look. Whatever you say. I love my daughter.  I'll send you the five hundred.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
Yeah.
This way.
You gotta be more careful about that shit. Gordon or one of those guys sees you smoking that wacky tabacky around me they'll expect me to bust you. And I'll be outta a job.
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Shit.
In the chest.
Out of this fucking job. This job sucks. Working outside in the winter sucks.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
I don't want to.
It's not that.
No.
No what?
Yes.
No.
Nothing.
What are you sorry for?
You mean Twombley?
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
You? Why?
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
I'm sorry.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
How?
I don't know for Christ's sake!
Is...? She's dead then?
Can --?
Makes me sad it was her. Instead of me. I shoulda froze.
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
Can't it wait, then?
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
You and me.
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
The night before the shooting.
How was she?
What happened?
No thanks. I don't drink.
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a professional hit. That'd make the feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
But you gotta hear this. You won't believe it. Mel Gordon had come by to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in his office.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Okay, I'm slowing us down.
Put your pilot on.
This doesn't make sense.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Yes, Mr. President.
I guess it depends on your perspective.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
What do you know of my husband?
So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
They've cut communication, and I spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. My only solution ran out of batteries.
Can't it wait?
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
But this is different, sir. You're the President.
Two... THREE. GO!
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing a couple ducks won't get it through committee.  Besides, Shep, I told you...  I don't shoot babies and I don't kiss guns.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Dunn.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
Elaine, what's going on?
You mean...
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Don't be too long.
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
That's okay, ROK.
Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
All right, it's a matter of death.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Then Elaine was right.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Surely you can't be serious.
Well...not for another two hours.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
But if you'll just give me...
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
Hello.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Good-bye, darling.
Yes, Captain?
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
Here.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
It is his new partner that I'm worried about.
Here?
Gesundheit.  You don't mind if I stick to George, do you?
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
Did you learn anything?
Did you talk to him?
In the camps, we were lodged four to a room.  The selection process was entirely random.  We did not get to stay with our friends... or families...
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
You are married?
You humans are very curious to us. You invite us to live among you, in an atmosphere of equality we've never known before.  You lay before us a beautiful green world, full of freedoms and opportunities... You give us ownership of our lives for the first time... and you ask no more of us than you do of yourselves: to live by the rules... rules that aren't made to keep one people subordinate to another, but rules that exist to preserve equality.  You aspire to very high ideals here.
She's very progressive.  I'm certain she's considering it.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
Why?  What's the big goddamn deal?
Tell me about it...
You understand that.  But how many others will?
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
Lucky for you, you got him in both of his... well, what we loosely refer to as... hearts.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective.
It is. 
Shit, if Kristin had to get married where I could afford it, we'd be holding the reception at Buddy's Burgers.
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
I can't!  Do you mind!
Ten seconds, people.  Look sharp!
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
See you soon.
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
I was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  Forget it.
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
Shut up.  Just shut up!
How do I get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
No.  No!  It ain't you.  They're inside.  Inside the perimeter. They're in here.
The embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  Gestating.  Then it...  ...then it...emerges.  Moults. Grows rapidly --
What about the colony transmitter? That up-link tower down at the other end.  Why can't we use that?
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
Newt.  My n-name's Newt. Nobody calls me Rebecca except my dork brother.
And hope to die?
Newt, wait!
That's right.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Because I don't have to.  The people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  And by the way, they call it Acheron now.
Good morning.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
Why not?
What's that?
Perhaps.
The marriage!
What?
Don't bother.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
No!
Yes!
Well, don't do that again!
Tell them to go!
Salzburg.  We were just talking about Salzburg.  If you've come from my friend the Fartsbishop, you've arrived at just the right moment. Because I've got good news for him. I'm done with Vienna. It's over, finished, done with! Done with! Done with!
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Why not?
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Oh, thank you, sir!
Isn't it obvious?
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor.  Who are you?
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Gertrude!
Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
Yes. He is a little strange.
And the result satisfies.
Of course not.
What? On one hearing only?
Twenty-six.
Sire, I swear to Your Majesty, there's nothing like that in the story. I have taken out everything that could give offense. I hate politics.
Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
They say you're in debt.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
Where?
What?
Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room.
Yes.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
This is Herr Mozart, my dear. The young man Herr Salieri recommended to teach our Gertrude. Where is she?
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
But what is it they don't like?
Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
Do you mean that?
Would you? Actually, you could.
We ended in F Major?
Yes.
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
Certainly, Herr Director.
Exactly. A dance.
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.
Do you know who I am? You never heard of me, did you?
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
Ah - you've heard that?
Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
I did.
But not his body.
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
Well done, Sire!
Did we?
Oh yes, yes. And that was?
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
Excuse me, my dear.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
What exactly did he call out?
What happened to them?
Yes, I believe he did.
David says Jack comes to warn him.
Yes.
And what else?
Dr. Hirsch?
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
No, a cab will be faster.
Tea would be nice.
How is that?
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
I dream of death mostly.
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
I know.
Now what do you want to talk about?
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
I was dreaming again?
Very nice.
It's nice to see you.
I should be committed.
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
David, stop!
No.
There's no call for that kind of language.
Why are you doing this to me?
Do you have bad dreams, too?
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
Yes.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
Good.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Shall we?
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Look at that.
You ask them.
Pecos Bill.
Come on, where?
Plan?
I'll tell you when we get there.
Shut up, you zombie!
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
He has?
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Yeah.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
What do you mean, help?
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
You understand?
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Why not?
Well, you can. You always could.
Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
What are you doing here?
Yes, sir.
It's funny - now that I'm here, I don't know just how to go about it.  You see, I kind of expected to find you here alone.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Thank you!
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Directors, eh? Long faces?
Yes, sir.
Hello, Helen.
Yes, sir.
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Why pick on him ?
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
Don't you think I know it?
Absolutely.
With what?
All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
That's all, Mrs. Halligan. Thanks.
What time did you get in?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
Okay, Matt.
Where's Charlie?
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
That was two hours ago.
You stay out of this, Bob.
What?
Nope.
Oh no...
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
I could use the walk.
You're not scared, are you?
In case we have to kill these sonofabitches, I don't want them to see us coming.
All right, calm down. I'll agree Sadie was a woman --
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
Yeah.
Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
It's better. It's a construction depot. They'll have the strongbox and some ammo and explosives for us to take. That way we can take on a bigger job.
Yep.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
-- Exactly. Because this is a war.
All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
Died a hero.
Go on. You're pretty much all healed up.
I fooled them into thinking I was alone.
Mm-hmm.
Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
You are a charmer.
Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
Shut up.  Uh, Doc, I was wondering if, uh, this evening, I could come by?
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
And we're good at it.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
That he was.
Somebody's in a vengeful smiting mood today.
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
But you got big!
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
I shouldn't tease a hero.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
"Hmm" what?
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
Swimming. Swimming is good.
Yes ma'am.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
That's the idea.
I figured.
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
I can't believe this.
It's going to be a long spring.
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Sounds like I'll have to. Don't fall asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?
Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate him.
Maybe.
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
Yes, darling?
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
You're inhuman.
I know her. I knew her.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Are you sure?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
I won't...don't worry.
Why not, you stupid bastard?
No, you...didn't?
What?
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Where to? Are you going to go get a gram?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Patrick?
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Forget it.
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Then why can't they get these stains out? I mean can you talk to these people or something? I'm not getting anywhere.
Who?
No.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
Perrier? San Pellegrino?
No, really. I'm okay.
Where did you go to school?
Nice. Very nice.
You seem...nervous.
You sure?
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
What?
Dan, great to see you again. Like I said, you need anything at all, I'm your man. I don't envy your job. I mean Owen was a...complex man.
I'll be there.
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
Yes.
Yes.
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and –  - you.
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
"Make" him?
You saved my life in alot of ways.
We're not gonna let it.
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
Milo. Why would he --
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
Remember Lyle Barton?
Oh, right. Hold on.
My goodness.
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
Oh. No thanks.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
You'd have to start practically from scratch. But this is all you'd be working on. No marketing meetings, no product seminars. We can't waste the time. Half the Valley's working on convergence. So're media conglomerates, cable companies, phone companies. 'Can't finish second, Milo. There is no second... Now what would you like to ask me?
Yeah? I wanna feel like I did when I wrote that. But I'm 42, that's 100 in cyber-years. I look at you and see the things that got me here.  But somehow got away.
...Do I?
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
I'm sure.
Were the flags for Teddy?
The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
You see what's hanging on the wall?
Longitude 48 degrees 06 minutes --
Longitude 109 --
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
What're we looking for?
You're famous around here.
...Were you?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
You're compulsive.
Then and now.  But not right now.
Why would you do a thing like --
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
It's three years old, it --
What?
Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
I could get it out of him.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Groovy.
Or sometimes not at all.
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Be careful.
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
Yes Basil?
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
My jumbo jet? Smashing baby.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
Here, use mine.
Do you want to talk to him?
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
Look at her hands, baby! Those are carpenter's hands.
Only sailors use condoms, man.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Shut up.
Fair enough.
I'll hurry back.
Likewise.
Lay it on me.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
My son?
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
Please allow me to demonstrate.
The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
Not me.
In due time.
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
Blow me.
I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
We don't judge here.
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
Really?
... death ...
He tried to warn us ...
The Institute ... the funding ...
Thank you, Steed.
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
What are my choices?
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
Whereas you are.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
Much better.
Mother?
Yes indeed. I need protection.
Oh, absolutely, but Trubshaw's a man worth meeting. No point setting out half shod.
And I suppose you're the knight.
All of a piece, really. A fanatical weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.  British Royal Organisation For Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.
Why should they think that?
Is that written in his shoe?
She had this in her mouth. There, there...
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
According to Dr. Darling, you're a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  Q.E.D.
Barely.
Mrs. Peel ... ?
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
I thought you played by the rules.
Where are you going?
But --
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
Half-brother to be precise.
Getting to what?
Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush English village transformed overnight into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
Why?
I'm warning you for the last time, Steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
She was ...
Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
When do the girls get to the party?
Five thousand dollars.
Yes, sir, I am.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
But how can I do that?
1002.
Yes, sir.
It looks awful.
Are you going to have women at your party?
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
I am committed. I love you.
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
I hope those guys are all right.
I think I screwed that one once.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Screw you!
Let's have a toast.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
Really?
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Feel free.
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
No sob story is going to change my mind.
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
C'mon. I insist.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
Very.
Who?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
He's alive.
In the Field Museum once.
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
Nah, he's nothin'. It's just sometimes... sometimes you just gotta punch somebody out, y'know?
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
How's it going?
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
I was doing my job.
I don't know anything about it.
I... I thought it was great. I loved it. It was nothing to these guys... medium deal.
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
I need another one, sir.
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
What are you listening to?
Trychticholorate. Then Swayzak can announce Seagrave was a murder.
I don't work for them, either.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
No, we have a stone killer trying to make a point.
Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
No.
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
Uh huh. And "Pioneer's Pride, Mobile Log Cabins". That was in your blood about six months wasn't it?
Coffee sucked.
Fixing my roof.
He's got piano lessons.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
You can't keep being his father...
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
That's your job.
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
What do you listen to, Stephen?
Don't you have any leads at all?
Just catch the son of a bitch.
This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
Me?
I forgive you.
Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
I forgive you.
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
There's nothing to think about. Either you put in my bet or you ain't getting nothing.
Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
Yeah, sucker. You better be there!
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
You've really got a problem.
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
How 'bout...
Ho!
Well you did.
Give me some?
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
Please.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
You ain't happy about the green light?
What are you talkin' about?
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
We're starving.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
But the line has to be drawn.
Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon. 
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
I've never been given a fair shot.
I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?
In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
Ya first bad move.  Projects been done.  That's one of the problems now, everything, movies, TV, are set in the urban jungle, da hood. That's so tired.  Mantan's Millennium Minstrel Show should be set on a plantation.  In Alabama. 
No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
Calm down, please.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
Go away, unless you got my money.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known.
What point is that?
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
Please don't go there.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
He, I'm Mona.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Oh, is that what I'm doing?
Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready.
Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
What you did is dead wrong.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Not at all?
I just turned twenty.
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
We should go out on a double date.
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Enough.
The good stuff.
Sloan, I got it like 'dat.
What?
I never was more in earnest.
I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
And so I am.
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
I believe they will deport you.
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
That is a trifle strong.
Have you not a man whom you value?
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
As much as possible?
All the same, you must name an amount.
Hmm-mmmm.
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
May I be quite frank with you?
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
The milkmaid's daughter?
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Who?
Fine.
Shut up, Mueller.
What do you mean, alone?
We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.
They're dead, aren't they?
I'm serious --
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
But not Pike's.
Yeah.
Can't do that now, though, can you?
Why?
That's exactly what he says about you.
Why?
Just look. Little pocket.
What don't you know?
No. I said Dunbar.
I was just thinking of what's going to happen to your careers when my father gets through with you.
I don't know --
Tell me what I can do.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
What about the confession?
What are you talking about?
I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
You and the Colonel go back.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Excuse me?
That is the most unprofessional --
Good cop/bad cop?
Microrecorder for Kendall -- didn't have time to wire his room. Now tell me why you joined the army or I'll jab this pen through your neck.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
I plan to grow on you.
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
No death certificates. No crime.
What if I don't want it?
You're a good man, Hardy.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
Oh, yeah, "Excuse me, Sergeant, sir, we don't feel like going out -- we don't want to get rained on." He'll kick our asses from here to Cleveland.
Poor fucker my ass...
But you didn't see it, right?
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Childs.
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
Sir, yes, sir!
Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
Not yet.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
I see. I thank you for your time.
Please. Go. Just go.
I know.
Well, it's not a short one.
You were talking about your wedding.
What's your name, Giant?
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Make him stop.
Did you do any of that?
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
Only on the surface. But that's all I've ever seen.
Like this.
Story of my life.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
Really.
There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
Did you?
Really! That's wonderful.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
No I haven't.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
What?
Yes. I know.
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Syevodnya
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I don't want to talk about him.
He will come back.
You don't want to talk about it.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
I got what I paid for.
You don't understand me.
Please, there's no... Oh.
Thank Christ for that.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
No.
Are you scared?
She's dead.
I'm trying to quit.
Okay. Thank you.
It's not mine either.
That'd be nice.
I need ya help again.
I do. God's truth. I do.
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
Yeah.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
Tehronne? Tehronne done this?
GAL! YOU HEARIN' MY VOICE?
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Why you got me chained?
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
No ma'am.
I tried.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
Uh-huh.
Naw!
Nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. And you know what? I'm good at it. Naw what I mean?
I didn't start this, R.L.
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
One thing at a time, Laz.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Please don't tell my daddy.
Can I ask you a question?  People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
Yeah.
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
I just wanted some make-up.
Thought you had a man for that.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
Home.
Why?
What?
Maybe we should do something?
Saving your life.
Where is the subway station, please.
Maybe we should bail?
I don't think he'd feel it.
Nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  Maybe I should work on that girl Joyce, she speaks the language.
Cool?
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
Sure.
Smells like Bayonne at low tide.
I'll check it out.
You can trust me.
A resort city, Beppu.
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
It's illegal, Nick.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
Nick, you can't do this.
Kampai.
A wife.  She left.
Luck.
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
How can you be so sure?
I need someone to translate for me.
You met her.
What do you chant?
Who am I supposed to be?
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
What...?  What if I say no?
Incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
I'm impressed.  But let's use the short form.  I'm looking for --
-- Kobo... I know.  He killed two of my partners.  One in New York, one at the printing plant.
If he won't cooperate?
And what can he do for you?
I'm afraid that's a little out of my...
You're just all so... so different.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
Just thought I'd...
He's not ready yet.
What was he after?
What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
Not if it works.
Next.
Number three.
I don't know.
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
No rust?
Yeah?
Nope.
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  Correct, Mr. Deckard?
I'd never get an abortion.
Ugh.
Right.
Where is he?
Uh-huh.
Just wait here.
Sorry.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Yes.  I couldn't pass the test.
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
You're all so perfect.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
It's Perry!
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
I know a short-cut.
Okay.
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Why not go to work for me?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
Sorry.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Two weeks.
That's what I was afraid of.
Of course.
I like it.
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
He has a computer?
May I please be excused?
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Not that one!
Did you?
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
My pleasure.
...I do.
Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
I promise.
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
What's baseball?
No. Sit down.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
No.
True.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Yeah...Seems to.
You don't look thirty-five.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
Really? No kidding?
You're my brave boy.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
Yeah.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
As long as we've got that straight.
To you maybe.
The locks?
Thirty -five years!
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
I've noticed.
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We do?
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Who did he leave with?
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
Yeah! That's thinking.
I don't know. I like to think so.
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
Yeah. How's Dad?
Anything you can tell me?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Who knows you have these?
Yes sir. I sure am.
Yes sir.
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
What do you want?
Yes.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
That's not crazy. I like you too.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Yes.
Shut up.
Sometimes I think I do.
No, it's not Don.
Dorothy. No!
Don? Where is he?
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Those are my breasts.
If you want to.
On a ride.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
What?
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
Good, let's drink up.
Anyone else? Alright Jeffrey, just a minute.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
Hey Jeff.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
I don't know. He moved away.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
I already know. The "Slow Club". It's on Route 7.
Yeah, but.
Okay, yeah, call.
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
You saw a lot in one night.
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world?
Yeah I guess so.  You're a neat girl.
Yeah, but I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Just some fatherly advice.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Go ahead.
Yes I'm going. I have to. I love you. I will, believe me.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
I mean it now. I carried the two of you little bastards around in my belly at the same time you ungrateful pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked me dry.  My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. I trip over em for Christ sakes, now ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!
Yes.
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
What?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
I'll call you tonight, afterwards. 
If that was a girl I want ta see some papers. She had ta be just preoperative for Christ sakes.
Okay. We're ready.
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for ten minutes.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
Uh... two shooters!
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
Really want to know?
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are you?
Sweet-n-low!
So you're not just talkin' mob guys. You're talkin' anyone, right? Even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?
No. You sure you're okay?
Y'know it is, a bit.
Just be natural, goddamit.
Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the fuck down!
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
This is he?
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
What do you think the cops have?
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
Five, seven, eight dollars.
Dignan! Stop!
I keep it for emergencies.
You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
You were spoiled rotten.
Even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
No kidding.
They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
Where was it parked?
I understand that if I had a few more friends like you and Bob I'd be dead.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
Yes, I do. Bob taught me.
I know that. But --
You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
You really hit a guy with a bottle?
Yeah. It's pretty good.
Yeah. As a girl.
OK. Roger.
I'll see you there.
What'd he get?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
What?
It feels good.
Yes, he did.
No. Bob did.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Yeah. He said that.
What was that?
I'm not playing any more golf.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Were you adopted, Bob?
Why do you say that?
Nothing. I was just asking.
No.
God, yes. Like silk.
What's he doing here?
We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Let's cut the bullshit.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
I warned you, Dignan.
You said it like it was a big joke, Bob. Like he's wild.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
So it's my fault?
What the fuck possessed you?
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
They said he's a drug dealer.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
All right! Backyard! Right now!
Run. Run. Let's go.
That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
Do you have your own cell?
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
Hand to hand combat?
You're going to need a boxman for this one. But that can be arranged.
Yes.
Why?
Well, I think --
He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it.
You Hoto?
Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you might've wandered a little past your pay-grade.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
Excuse me.
Okay. What if someone decided to cover their tracks by blaming Conklin and Bourne. What if Bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
Keep going...
Show me again...
No, I do.
You killed them.
Look at me.
Is this really happening?
Felt a little light.
I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
I don't know! Why would I lie?
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
It's just a nightmare.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
So...
I only dream about people who are dead.
Get on it.
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
No. You never worked Berlin.
Who?
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
-- the hotel -- how far? --
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?
Me? Four years.
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
So he fooled you.
You mean, did I want a date?
Because he's doing just what he said he'd do. He's coming for us.
Are we locked up?
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
He strained his leg so that it pains him to ride. But he sends his greetings -- and says that I speak for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
Scotland. He intends --
Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
Hamish, I... thank...
You win.
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
Wife of Edward, the king's son?
It's battle I want, not talk.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
How long will I be in here?
Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
Fix?
You need to see the prison shrink, man.
Weirder than this?
Huh?
Hi, Lenny.
No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
What do you mean?
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
Why's that?
Stop! Take me back!
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
Gee, thanks friend.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
What happened?? Where are we?!
I come from a big family.
I don't think Evan gets to be in it --
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
I won't.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
Thank you very much. Good day.
Yes?
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
It doesn't matter.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
But Richard, no, I, I --
Some of the old songs, Sam.
I will, don't worry.
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
Thank you.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
Here it is.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
Even in Berlin.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
And if it should change?
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
This is the end of the chase.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Okay.
He'll take one.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
Huh?
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
Put that gun down.
Our expenses?
What is your nationality?
Get me the Radio Tower!
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
Six kilometers.  Four miles.
Going to die anyway.
No.
I'm putting it off.
Water water water --
They'd eat you if they could.  They're laughing at you.  Listen.
No!
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
Must be a story there.
Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
Not if you work for FedEx.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
I have to.
I would have done the same thing.
You have any children?
It means a lot...that you came.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Which I didn't have.
Mom, meet Jango.
What about the sender?
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
But I might not have.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
That's all there is.
No sweat.
No please, join me.  Some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
They just want you to hire some new help.
Why not?
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
You cook very well!
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Good night, Daddy.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
But you had so much *responsibility*.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
They wanted a girl.
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
Only the right people can have you, Curly.
You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
He's leaving...
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
It's okay--I don't mind.
Have you enlisted?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
Migrants?
Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
Yes, for both.
What *else* could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use.
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
I don't know.  Just promise me one thing.
We heard that one already, Homer.
I don't like watching anyone be sick.
Not yet. What do you know about it?
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
But you don't look very happy.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
Shit. We don't know what he is.
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
What view?
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
He ain't never been outta Maine!
What do I do? I'm the VP of Finance.
And you have this letter of intent?
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
Know who I am, Jake?
Gee... What makes you say that?
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
My father used to play the same fucking lotto numbers with these other guys in the pharmacy. The same numbers everyday for sixteen years. One day he gets pissed off, tells them he's out and plays his own numbers. They hit the Lucky Seven for one point two million.
It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
Well, this is just fucking great...
It gets worse. Now I know why he was such a good rope. I mean, cash... That much and we never had to put him on the "Send?" Turns out this ducking Moe was an accountant for the King Pin.
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
We'll use the Euc.
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
I need you to stake me.
We're not cops.
Says who?
Oooh. Sassy. What do you care who feels me up, Jake? Unless it kinda gotcha going. Did it, Jake? Getcha going?
I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
Sort of. I was telling him about this great love of my life who's name I don't remember, and I could see... He was getting pissed. I thought it was just because he was worried about me, but... He told me that I was stupid because my boyfriend didn't really love me.
Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
What do you want? An apology?
I'm getting a ride.
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
And we got rid of the red head.
What was it?
With identification.
This is embarrassing.
Of what? They're both crooks.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
What?
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
The King.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
You are Officer Richard Rottovich. And this would be Officer Walter Sobozinski. I'm looking for Jake Vig.
I want him for something big and to do that, we have to catch him in the act.
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
What's he going to do? File a missing drugs report? If it works out, this guy might be good for a few more turns.
My car's in the garage.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
Seven-fifty.
Habib?
How's that football story corning along?
You want me drunk?
I've got something to tell you.
How did you land that?
I love you Jack, you know that.
Probably.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
You're entitled to your opinion.
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.
It's not that.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.
You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
I can't do it, Jani.
Let it go.
I took the bandage off yesterday.
Who did it? Tell me!
Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.  I'm on your side, Jack. I don't need an enemy.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Give me 365.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
Yes.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
Very impressive.
I can see.
Bruised.
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
The key!
Where is it? What did you do with it?
It didn't go off.
Fuck that shit.
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
What?
Commander Powell is dead.
I like it up here.
...You see, I can watch things up here, Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors and asteroids, gas clusters...
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
What was that, Doolittle?
Sorry.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
We're running out of time, sir.
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
Yeah?
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
That's a lotta crap.
None of your business.
You know each other?
You're not still pissed?
No way.
I ain't mad at you...
Every week.
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
I don't want to move away.
When?
Girlfriend?
The other one like you...
How much do you know?
Your basic hodge-podge.
I've never been much for trying to understand why bad things happen, I just know they do.  So the job's to figure out how to deal with the consequences.  Which you did... You took that sonuvabitch out.
Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
Can't help you.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
I think you should go now.
I understand.
You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
What?
And because I actually kinda feel sorry for guys sometimes.
They don't have a lot of moving parts.
Only one I can think of.
But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
I'll bet you can.  Sit.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
I have sincere eyes.
You get it when I get her.
You're the best, Maxie.
Tell everybody hey.
Right, the big one-oh.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
You don't.
True, but--
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Who's Whiskey Dick?
Bye.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
What? That's disgusting!
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
For the next hour and a half it's every dude for himself. Try to get at least one ticket and at 8:30 P.M. we'll meet over there.
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.
It's my Bullworker.
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Well, she was a very tempting siren, Father. Built like you wouldn't believe. So I gave into temptation about a block away from the wedding reception at this little motel that charges by the hour.
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
It's not nearly enough, punk.
Not if I shoot first!
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
School's cancelled.
Sure.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
What makes you think I'm not?
Wonder where we'll be then.
Until it withers away.
Why is that?
We never would have had this conversation.
Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
It's safe here.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
Do they know yet?
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
Sometimes it's the only thing that keeps us going.
Frank.
Don't you watch the news?
Follow him where?
How are things going at school?
How does that make you feel?
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
But you were punished.
How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Then how is time travel possible?
Soon. Time is almost up.
If the sky were to suddenly open up... there would be no law... there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories... the choices you've made and the people you've touched. The life that has been carved out from your subconscious is the only evidence by which you will be judged... by which you must judge yourself. Because when this world ends, there will only be you and him... and no one else.
Her name is Gretchen.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
I would like to put him through more hypnotherapy... and increase his medication.
Rose... I don't know if you realise how great an opportunity this is for our daughters. This has been a dream of ours for a long time.  Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
I stole four beers from my dad.
Where is she?!
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
Really, Loretta?
...Yah -- well, at least, y'know, I got to perform. And Mom got to see me.  I guess number eight only worked for Diane Sawyer...
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
My jacket. Take it 'cause, y'know, I got my costume okay'd before the pageant. You can wear it.
C'mere. I love you so much.
Amber, I'm sorry. I really am. But you know the rules. All talent costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys before the pageant.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
You could be quiet.
Shut it up, Loretta.
What?
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
Yeah, yeah, the Jew.
Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
All right, let's go.
Enid ate a whole pan!
"My President"...
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
All right -
What do you whistle?
Did you shoot the rapids?
Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
Is that so?  I used to think you were two-faced - but you can't be - or you wouldn't be wearing that one. Now - let's talk this thing over.
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
Fine.  We gotta him. 
So! -- He's on your side, too.
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride. 
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
$50?
You upstart!
I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
Why -- why -- of course.
WHAT  ?
What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
One or two?
I'll join you shortly.
I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He must have taken quite a fall.
Why is he sitting up like this? He needs rest.
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Right... Right.
Don't be mad. This muck can kill you.
Indeed!
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.
Oh no?
y-y-yes--
Won't be a moment.
Good morning.
But it's so good, I mean... it's so very good.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
Righteousness for his namesake.
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
Thank you very much.
That's a canopy, John.
Oh yes.
Yes, John?
Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
No, he's very upset about something.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
Aren't you being just a little harsh, Mothershead? You yourself hardly treated John with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
Yes sir.  What's that?
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Never mind. I'm the owner.
I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
Well, of course. We always welcome friends.
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
What?
No, I mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you'd met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be YOUR goals... whose dreams seem to be YOUR dreams?
It was different...
I've never LOVED anybody!
Halfdan the Black.
But, Erik...
Of course.
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
Then let go!
No... no...
Is it summer or winter, Erik?
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
But you don't want to hear it.
Right! Summon the musicians! We'll do the one that goes "TUM-TUM-TUM- TUM-TI-TUM-TUM"
Don't talk nonsense.
Not when we explain about the Great Blessing.
What about the raping?
Sh!
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
About raping me?
You DON'T like it, do you?
I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
It saved my father!
We toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
Who have you been talking to?
Sorry.
Shut up. You there. You there and you there.
What "magic"?
You'll see!
Why should WE care?
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
To the oars!
I've got you!
Nobody gets killed.
We'd be the first!
We haven't got a spare place.
Over the Edge of the World.
Please.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
Hang on...
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
Well... I... I thought...
We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
You fool!
But it's a responsibility...
I must KILL! Kill!
Erik's right! We'll all meet in Valhalla.
I'm not frightened... of anything...
No... he's not... not... there...
No, Mother.
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
Rockville Center.
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
I'm sure you would.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Probably see you at the book store.
I like to read.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Yes.
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
Where are you going?
I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
What?
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
This is our first "date" date.
I'm sure, I said.
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
You said --
It's freezing out here.
No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Make love?
Hey, Joel --
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Joel, we've fucked. We've made love. Like a million times. And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. Isn't that lovely?
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
Well... I did.
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
You take it. I don't know.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
I'm glad you called.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
'Night.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Go.
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
You made me have an abortion.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
It's a quote book.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
About...
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
Like what?
I have to go, Julian.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
I don't know anything about it.
This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?
I'll be all over it.
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
Coffee.
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
It is not.
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
His vitals are stable, but he's unresponsive to stimuli. He might wake up in fifteen minutes. He might not wake up at all.
We'll make it.
"Another man?" Who?
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
A power drain --
It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
How do you know all this?
Justin.
The ship had life support systems for eighteen months. They're been gone seven years.
I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
If it worked, yes.
The date.
Intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it's possible...  Black holes make sense on paper, it's all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  The Event Horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like Lazarus, returned from the dead.
I don't know.
I don't know...
That's exactly what we don't have, Doctor.
Watch me.
Then who the fuck are you?
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
Captain, we got a problem.
I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
Come again, Skipper?
One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark.
What about the life readings you picked up?
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
What's causing the readings?
There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
Justin's in the airlock.
...repeat, we're armed...
He's been past Mars?
DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
I've seen bodies before. This is different.
Can you shut it down?
Range 3000 meters and closing.
Picking up magnetic interference.
Explosive decompression.
Decompression wouldn't do that.
Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
I'm sorry.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Is it safe?
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Oh, he did.
Victor must've taken him.
He also said we'd avoid that storm in space. And we know how that turned out.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
This makes five.
Solid.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Am I okay?! You wanna explain that?!
'Course not. Strictly business.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
What do you mean "complete"?
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
That's terrible news...
Not this again --
You've been working out.
Right, whatever, have fun.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
History, Leonard. History. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Yes, thanks.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
Not at all.
Ben's still out there --
Reed, we're running out of time.
Ben did this.
Ben did this?
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
There it is!
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
I'll explain everything later.
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
I know it's yours.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
I'm really pretty busy...
Damone! You come here?
Jesus. I'm sorry.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
How often do you go?
I don't go at all.
Totally.
Then don't hassle it.
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
Just be glad you're all right.
What should I do?
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
What's the big deal?
No. But it's a nice idea.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
It couldn't be.
Not coming? What happened?
Yeah, like maybe never.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
Aloha, Spicoli.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.
You keep them.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Not at all.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
What's April 16th?
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
What about the notes?
Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Holy shit!
Naw!
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
They'll probably have a big net for us when we show up.
To do the job, of course. Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars!
We wandered into a fucking time capsule!
I want to leave fast.
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
That's right, laugh about it! You goddamn honkies are all the same!
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
Man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!
Just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a McDonald's hamburger stand. She was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!
Me?
Right!
Yes!
Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
They'll get in! We'll all die!
We're going to get my little girl.
Yeah.
Who the hell would you call?
C'mon guys--
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
No. You?
Well, why don't you keep your observations to yourself?
Go douche.
Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
Max?
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
What the hell's going on here!?
BONSAI!
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
Father. The biggest, the strongest...
Make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. There's cars back there, right?
What did we say about lying?
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
Here, take a few of these. Studio makes 'em in the basement. They keep the fat off.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
He's not here.
A rich actress.
Sort of.
Who?
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Dick...
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
I know you believe that.
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
No. Never.
Is Kaminski a Communist?
...Then go.
Be careful, Francie.
I know that, Dad, but --
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
Daddy!
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
No, I don't hate it.
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
Well? What'd you think?
I just wanted to see how you looked.
What?
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
What?
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
I know.
What for?
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
...Take advantage of me.
I guess.
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
No. To thoroughbreds.
Frances, You're crazy.
Frances, it's me, Harry?
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Run!
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --
You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
But I want to. I'm trying!
Yes, Ma.
Mama, what's...
What?
What's wrong?
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
I have!
Oh bullshit.
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
This whole thing is a joke!
You're telling me you feel guilty.
No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders...  ...and your pencils...  ...and your god-damn buttons...  ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
One-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
The world is a dizzying place.
All my life I've known.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
I do. But you must trust me for now.
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Quite a few.
Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
Somebody has to!
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
You'll be leaving then.  Just as well. You never were cut out for this, Henry. Goodbye.
You've been going round-the-clock?
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
Your men are right to be afraid.
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
I was careless.
You told her to sweep the courts.
Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
You want to leave?
Well, it hasn't been that long.
Absolutely.
They're off now.
Hey, guys!
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
It's over twenty miles to the crossroads. Steve'll be back in an hour. Things will straighten out then. We'll take his Jeep and get help.
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
Somebody'll see.
Where's Ned?
Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you." "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Whassamatta?
I got to.
I mean...
For two lonely nights.
Why not?
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Vacation. I'm taking him to see his first bullfight.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
So do I just follow you?
Yeah, follow us.
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
In heaven.
Yes.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
Other places have beds, they also have cable TV, a gym, room service...
Not many.
Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.
I would say that's a very safe assumption.
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
Gotcha!
Do they have a waterbed?
She's in the other room.
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
Yes, Seth, I understand.
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
No, I didn't.
I don't know, you just passed out.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
It don't look together.
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee?  I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts.
Jordan, dear.  How are they treating you?
Would you care for a beverage?  Tea?
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
I'm not sure what --
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Should probably ask him that.
I'll work on it, ma'am.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
I believe he earned it for saving a man's life in Saudi Arabia.  He wanted you to have it.  He was very clear on that point.
Just a coincidence?
Chances of recovery?
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
Me?  Why me?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
Well, now I feel so much better.
It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway.
Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides...
Sure, sure.
Educate her, Pyro.
Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh?
She led us right to you.  That's no threat?
Okay, O'Neil.  So you've impressed all the others.  Now try me.
Shut up, sir.  I'm concentrating.
We are so fucked.
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
Go in there. Talk to her.
No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
But we can get to the west side faster.
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
I can't.
It's your choice.
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
Not now. You got my bag?
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
We know.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
Oh yeah, the insurance guy.
I need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
How do I do that?
...Yes sir.  Your quarters sir.
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
I heard something. A squeal.
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
Hey, watch that "Laredo" shit.
...Sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'
Why didn't you stop at the market?
FRONT ARMOR IS GONE! JUST SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE!
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
We'd never have the budget for this.
Up.
We're getting major structural damage.
I never get tired of that joke.
The enemy is matching velocity.
Right.
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
It's... I don't know.
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
You just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
What the hell are you talking about?
Mark 12.
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
Sure, no problem.
That thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  Face it, he's dead.
Closer?  I can try.
Okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. Fire red particle cannons full. Fire gannet magnets left and right. Fire pulse catapults from all chutes. And throw this thing at him too, killer.
Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?
Simpler.
This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
Theramin.
It's perfectly safe. I promise.
Why don't you just turn it on and see?
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
While they're strung out?
There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
Well, sir, then is it possible you called us all here just to hear what you wanted to hear.
They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
No one knows...
Who's in command out there?
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
You invented this, this...
How can you say that?
My baby daughter has died... my baby... mon petite Henriette...
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
I will not betray you, Nathanael.
But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner.  Sir.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
Just because they are born?
I see...
Don't be silly, you have whole worlds to fathom.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
So where's the money?
No. What's this?
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
Your who?
Yayo. Where is he?
You gave him the money?
He's around someplace.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
It was Rio Bravo. Robert Mitchum was the drunk in El Dorado, Dean Martin in Rio Bravo, practically the same part. John Wayne, he also did the same thing in both. He played John Wayne.
I can't do it.
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
Yeah, I was wondering why he should do that.
We'll talk about that, Harry. But first I gotta know, how'd you hook up with Chili Palmer.
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Who is this?
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
Or else what?
That's right.
You have a card in here?
I am. I'm a fan of everything that's L.A. I love it out here.
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
Where you been, Harry?
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
You wouldn't be talking to me if you were.
So you don't work for the casino?
One of his best parts.
She's a rock star. Every day, same time, they come down here and have breakfast. He has the egg white omelet; she has the banana pancakes. He sits facing west so he can see his billboard. She faces east so she has an excuse to wear the shades.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
Just a thought.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
Yeah, Chili. Hi.  You're fifty feet in the air!
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
What Get Away jet?
Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.
Like this?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
Here's another tip...
It's all mine.
Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.
"Cotton".
Yeah, well Martin is known for his flipping. He flips over a script, and when the time comes to make a deal, he flips out.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
What do you think?
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
I want to know.
Not unlike the way Nicki met him. Except it was a wrap party. Why?
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
You don't like Martin much, do you?
You thought I was faking?
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
Couldn't find my toothbrush.
Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
I don't hear anything.
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
Mob guy?
What money?
Hello, Martin.
And after all, you have such morals.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
What? You sure?
Damn mind of it's own.
We'll see who's dreamin', m'man.
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
Maureen.
Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Maybe he isn't alone.
Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
She take a radio?
Not in the eyes of the law.
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Right.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
I didn't touch the fucking radio.
Conveniently enough for you.
Then you're a lucky man.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Hell, yeah. I like it cold. Colder the better.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
Greer?
Same. Any luck?
I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Victims of what?
Just lucky I guess.
Right here.
Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.
It's the ship. The ship's making you think this way.
You got that right.
Yeah.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
Better late than never.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Who?
Nothing.
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
Can I come in?
Nothing.
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
Okay... I promise.
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Did you sign up yet?
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
Oh, we totally have to.
What is this?
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
Which loser?
Oh yeah.
You're better at it.
Totally! Look!
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
You won't believe it! Guess!
But those are our people...
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
Don't you want nice stuff?
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Nothing.
I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."
That's okay...
Get a job!
Fine, and how are you?
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
I have about fifteen hundred 78s at this point. I've tried to pare down my collection to the essential...
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
Good luck...
I'm totally serious!
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
I really don't think it's a good idea.
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
For nineteen years...
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
What? Why?
I won't even dignify that with a response.
Hi, it's me...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
Well when can we do something?
So, do you like me, Seymour?
In what way do you mean?
What's the matter?
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
What about Joe?
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
I wish I could see him.
I am.
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
What are you talking about?
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
Do you have a check for me?
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
As are they all.
-careful, Abdullah-
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
Don't they, though?
Starling?
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
-not a time for modesty, Bob-
Tell me about Beaumont- does he understand how brilliant you are, how lucky he is to have you?
It was embarrassing- the man showered me with compliments.
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
You do plan to mark it a bit more precisely than just-  -"there."
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
But you said they were always old.
That's very considerate.
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
Because I think they're after you.
Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came. 
The workers don't get on?
I expect so- it's from my wife.
I do, actually; very much.
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Not even close.  What happened?
Help finish the railroad.
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
I know.  Marry me, Dana, and together we will raise Vigo as our son.  There are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  I'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  And perhaps a car and free parking.
Didn't I do it?
That's exactly what you said last week.
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
Let me jingle you right now.
So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
That's very practical.  I hate going out on New Year's Eve, too.
So they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which I'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so I guess it's all right.  I can finish this later if you're tired.
Okay.
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
Yes.
Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
This won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman. It's hot and it's ready to pop.
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
What's the reading?
I can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. Sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. And there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  But there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  We just have to mobilize it.
I knew that voice sounded familiar.  What's up?  How's it going?
Me?  I'm a little of everything.  Some Irish, some German, some French, Dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  And that's what made this country great.
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
Well, you're doing great.  Keep it up.
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
Hi, Louis.
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Can't you tell me now?
You must have gotten the last copy.
All right.  Since you put it that way.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
Thank you.  Next time I want to break a lease I'll know who to call.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
Back off, man!  I'm a scientist!
I don't believe in luck.
Did you ever report it to anyone?
I'm not at liberty to say.
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
The magic word is "please."
A square?
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
All right, Peter.  Good night.
I blame myself.
That appears to be the case.
What do we do now?
What do I say?
I guess I got a little overexcited.  Wasn't it incredible!  I'm telling you, this is a first.  You know what this could mean to the University?
No sense worrying about it now.
Where are you, Pete?
Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Mmmhmmm.
And the seas would boil ...
And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
You're coming back?
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
But I get what I want, always, don't I?
Yes?  Go on!
Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
I'm serious.
Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
Jerses -- tomorrow...
Yes, Caesar.
I don't know...
I'll nose around...
You know there were riots last night.  Now the unrest has started again and Commodus has sent for an army division.  You understand what you are doing...
Proximo, we need to talk about my one third... I imagine the betting booths will be doing good business. And, what was the name of that olive oil company?
God of passages and changes?
But have never been?
How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
My loyalties... were in doubt.
They can't... if this is Rome...
Sneaking around with your brother?
Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men?  How like my father you are.  You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.
He killed his father and then my family...
Tomorrow?
Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
Athenians...
Of course...
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
I'm a Greek, thank you.  And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians.  Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white.  Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend.
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
Right, right, what am I thinking of?
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
Yes.
Why not?
I'm sorry I took you in there.
You mean the one who --
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Because -- I am.
How could you do that, Benjamin?
What did she say?
Then what?
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Thank you.
Not exactly.
What?
I hate that. I won't stand for it.
You heard me. Out of here.
Yes.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
I'm in the bathroom.
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
A single room or a double room?
Where is it?
What?
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
In general.
What?
What for?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Sit down, Benjamin.
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Yes?
Right.
Then why do you keep running away?
Oh my God.
Let me out!
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Do you want me to get it?
That's fine.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
Either one will be fine.
Who said it was my first time?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
I don't.
I got up.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
We're talking.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Right.
We don't.
About five years.
How many times a year.
I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
Well, wait a minute. You married him.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Kind of.
Because I don't want you to.
Good.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Of course you did.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
But it's not.
I just don't believe you would do that.
I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.  Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him.  Are you armed?  No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.
What the hell have you done?
I don't think so.
Very good, sir.
I'd like you to know my sister, Miss DeWitte --
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
No wait. Wait.
Not if you don't want to.
You don't?
I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --
I've got to go.
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
You'll never be young again.
I know.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
No, I don't.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
Benjamin Braddock.
This boy -- I'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar -- but before he does --
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
Why?
No --
If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back --
Money -- Ever heard of it?
What?
You're very funny --
All right. We'll dance.
You live here?
Oh!
Yes -- oh!
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
And -- and --
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
What is the matter?
Yes -- yes -- yes.
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
Don't.
Bless you --
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
Broke -- A Baron? But, Baron --
Be quiet.
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
No, Doctor.
Nobody, Doctor.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night. 
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
No -- I must find it --  Fourteen thousand two hundred marks. 
Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
No - absinthe.
Yes.
You're trembling.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
I got ten marks for that.
Moreover...
What?
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
Not too quickly.
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
Tomorrow morning.
No -- now.
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
Yes.
Baron!
Oh, no.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
No water -- What a place!
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
You haven't time.
You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end. 
Last night?... There was no applause.
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
I could not think of not accepting.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
What is this insolence?
Go away -- go away.
When she gets her paint on and hears the music -- she'll be all right. I know these people.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
Good night.
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.
Bobo, no, I --
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
You're a thousand percent right!
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
So here we are!
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
You're right! And this boy tapped into that main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. Do you know what that means?
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
These machines -- They're in here.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
I'll get you a check.
It's not your fault.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
We won't hit the track. The beach. Couple a nice restaurants.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
I know you do, so that's why --
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
Uh-huh.
No.
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
We'll work something out, Joe.
You ain't seen nothin.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
Is that right?
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
Yeah? How?
Upstate.
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
She didn't see you, in other words.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
No! Because I --
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.
That's natural.
Gun?
Yes, I know, I know.
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
Ate the gun. Oh.
No question, huh?
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Where?
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Carter.
Funny, we just drove right in.
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
I thought you'd never ask.
I was trying to get away from someone.
Just get on the bus.
I'm not leaving without her.
Why not?
I guess.  It's just hard to believe.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
Still wants to move out?
This kid just wants his freedom.
What?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
Michael Meyers.
Yeah.
Can't you?
Linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
You've been watching too much TV.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
Him.
He's gone.
Kara, no!
It's not working!
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
An old friend.
It was you.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
We've never met.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
Used to be against the law, didn't it?
At least we found the diamonds.
This room is full of ghosts.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
So long, Colonel.
Let's talk about something else.
How about breakfast, wife?
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
Huh.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
I wanted to apologize.
Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
Thank God!
Do you know who Wanda June is?
Dr. Woodly.
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
They were in the same creative writing class.
College?
Excellent!
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
Penelope!
Mom?
No.
Open the bolt!
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
I don't want to fight you.
It's your house, Dad.
I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
Some kind of animal?
I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
Disease?
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
Such as?...
Go on.
And what is his most cherished possession?
If he wants to go.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
Blue soup?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Sounds quite beautiful.
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.
Out!
You've killed women?
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
She's crying because she's so happy.
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
I can just hear the editorial wee- wee-weeing when Looseleaf and I start flying in pacqualinincheewa root.  I can hear the Alice-sit-by- the-fires now: "We discovered it in the Amazon Rain Forest.  Now we cure you with it.  Now we lower our eyes with becoming modesty as we receive heartfelt thanks."
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
The same hairy, humorless old gods who move you from hither to yon. "Honor, " if you like.
Poison.
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
I see.
My violin is avenged!
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
Get up.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
It's trash now, like mine.
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
The wife of Harold Ryan is going to marry a pansy next?  This is the end of Western Civilization as far as I'm concerned.  You must be crazy as a fruitcake.
Stay home tonight!
That's an interesting piece of news.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
What does he say to do?
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
My father!
He isn't any friend of Father.
No!
He'd assume we had.
Is he all right?
Far as I know.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
That's the XKE.
I wish Paul luck.
I'm amazed.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
Goodbye.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
I just want to ask some questions.
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
You want a tip?
What do you mean?
We offer...
Not really. But if you want me to tone it down...
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Do you know where she lives?
When do we start?
Jesus.
And your wife? Where's she?
'Sucking off.'
Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as good as you?
Neither am I.
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
Yeah, yeah, go on.
Fuck.
What makes you so sure?
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
So then, Mr. Mast...
I'm back in Grand Rapids.
I've got a meeting...
I've got some news. Your daughter's all right. At least I think she is.
That's like a stag film.
Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Yeah, sure.
Pretty good.
How did you find me?
Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
What you got in mind?
It's a short film.
I don't know nothing, man.
No.
Well, Bill -- mind if I call you Bill?  Let me be frank. I've made a lot of money. I've got my own business in Detroit. Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body.  Well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told me I should shelter some money, I thought I'd try this.
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
Cool off, huh? How's this for cooling off?
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
You're taking a big chance.
At least I improved myself. What's up?
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
Thanks.
Oh, <u>yes</u>? Well, that's all right. I've got a brother who's a real cut-up, too. I'll never forget the time we had this old TV set with no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck his head behind it and started giving a newscast before the whole family. We were all hysterical. And here's little Tommy pretending to be Walter Cronkite.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Hello.
None of that, lady.
No.
Check.
And that truck - is it registered in your name?
Lady! Be quiet.
What kind of a car is it?
Fern. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance.
I'm in charge of all the invoices for the southwest. We supply, for example, most of the egg farmers in Southern California. So you can imagine.
Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
Maude???!
She seemed yare to me.
Yes. Very much.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
That's a nice teapot.
What is it?
Why not?
Yes.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
Maude, do you pray?
With Life.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
She took my head.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Well, they're my species.
I took them out.
I'll never forget you, Maude.  But I would like a photo of you.
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
I have a sore throat.
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
A sunflower?
Oh, I studied the guitar. I had to give it up. Gave me calluses on my fingers. As an actress I can't afford to have a tarnished instrument.
Like a tea ceremony?
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
Why?
Yes.
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
You think so, sir?
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
But wait...
What's the matter with her?
Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
I've got to finish it.
I've come for my father!
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
Steve...
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
See? I don't like that --
I abhor violence.  Sergeant Whitman, I hope you don't think me mad --
C'mon -- Rasputin??
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
Listen to me. This time is different. There's more at stake than ever before.
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Anung-un-Rama...
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
-- should go back. Now!
Hey. You: think twice --
Not from you.
How big can it be?
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
You're going alone?
I like that...
Just take it slowly.
Oh, sod you.
What's the problem?
Uh-huh.
Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
Who are you?
No!
You did this before, right?
HE did. I've seen him.
No.
You want it?
Oh my God.
What happened to you?
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Tell me, damn you.
A box?
Let me see.
I said no.
I need a skin. Then we leave --
What's the problem?
O.K. O.K.
He won't complain. He can pay off some of his creditors.
You mean we're moving in?
In here.
Shit.
Are you O.K.?
What's wrong with you?
Plain soda?
No.
I prefer the floor.
Yeah, why don't I?
Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
I'll get the doctor.
Wait a moment --
Steve?
I love you too.
I guess.
I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
I have to get out.
So lie down.
I see.
Oh no.
'Bye.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
Terrific.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
No.  We need the gig.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
I have all of the others.
You can be and are wrong.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
Is there a difference?
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
Yeah, sure...
Hey Rob.
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Oh God, no.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
Maybe I should talk to him.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
Well stay for tonight, then.
Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
Will you please just go?
That bad, eh?
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
You're tougher.
Harder.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Where?
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
Fair enough.
So?
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
Well, you've asked.
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
You haven't even seen it!
I'm sure it isn't.
When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
Good.
Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
Thirteen hundred.
Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
No, we...
I'm Vince.
Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill.  I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank.  So he isn't a cop.  District anyway.
How old is Richard?
Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
Didn't think it was my buddy over there.
You're very macabre.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
Yes.
Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with.  Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do.
Grave robbers?
He's dead.  Whatever I may or may not feel means exceedingly little to him now.
You?
Are you?
You are.  Now.
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
I wish I could.
Yes.
Why are you here?
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
It'll never stick.
What were you doing in Felton?
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Never take up poker, Detective.
It's that important?
It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
Give it a rest Ned, huh?
Aye.
Pheasant.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
It is less.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
It is the truth.
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
Me arm hurts.
Muy Bien!
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
I do not think I like the sound of that.
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
Finish yours?
They're nothing but boys.  It will be a slaughter tomorrow.
What is your position?
It can be different.  It must be.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Kahn?
What are you doing here?
And if I refuse?
Let's just say that in my years with this department I've seen more than one well dressed business man look for a hand job on 14th Street.
That's none of your business.
We were very close.
When may I expect the cleaners?
I'll send them right up.
Just your pappy scared some.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
Sort of a Jack London style?
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
Did you finish the interview?
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
No. My mother.
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
The money? Why?
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
Out of the mouths of babes.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
What home?
Dead?
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Say, could I meet him?
Now you got me.
Thanks.
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
Yes. Where is he?
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
Where's some paper?
Where's Butch?
What tickets?
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
Was she? Did you notice?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Is this the Community Hospital?
Will you come here?
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
Sure.
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
You grey-haired old Judas!
What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
Who do you want?
You got plenty of money?
I always have both.
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
Yes, I suppose so. It all helps.
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
Okay.  Up you go, Mollie.
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
Little rum in yours, too?
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
Go on -- shoot me!
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
What did you do with her?
Who is it?
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
Okay, Hildy.  Well, we can't get any official statement --
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
That's good.
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Keep away!
Well, maybe you think I could!
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
What's from the Governor?
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
I give that marriage six months.
Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
You'll be at home for the weekends. Now shut up, or walk.
Apparently so.
Now put them together. Bugger off, you bloody sod.
Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
Wow!
Who pays for them?
Didn't you feel the house rock? You must have seen all those shell bursts.
Did you? You thought you did. We've been gypsed, all our lives. Look at your street.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Why not?
And I'm still just a lad myself.
You joined up.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
Fair enough.  The river.
The ideas you get in your head.
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Wasn't it lovely?
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
You might still have a house.
Tipsy, topsy, turvy.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Yikes.
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
Oh, he's coming, he got something real special this year.
Yeah, I like the screaming too... it's so much more exciting.
Oh yeah, the tree.
I wonder what time it is. Seems kind of late.
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
You know... a couple of queers.
Oh, wonderful.  Fucking psycho.
You shouldn't a done that.
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Perfect.
Hell yeah.
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
Where ya headed?
There's not enough room.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Quiet.
Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I disturbing your viewing pleasure?
I gotta open the gate.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
What'd you see, who was she with, where were they going?
Is that all... think real hard.
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Well Christ boy, don't stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
Call Wydell.
Dr. Satan?
What.
That must be him.
Right...  ...come on.
Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
It's embarrassing, okay?
You're fucked up, Lila.  Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake.
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Oui.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
That's not how he tells it.
I don't know. Something's missing.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Shut up and tell me.
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Yeah?
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
Oh?
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
And I think I'm going to.
As do I.
Where?
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
I'll be out in a minute.
Why certainly!
I don't know. Something.
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
Your entire body?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Shit.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Yes.
You look different... More relaxed.
Right.
Soon as I finish my coffee.
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
You know what's good for him?
Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.
Deal the cards.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
Cash.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
Poker's not your game.
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Now, when did you adopt me?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Come on, let's go...
Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
Well, I win sometimes.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
You hustlin' me?
'Bout even.
What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it.
All right. Five hundred.
You want me to tell her for you?
Half.
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
Aaaahhhh!
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around ya.
Want some free advice?
I don't want it.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
Aw, Eddie.
How much?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
Okay, friend.
How much are you ahead?
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Yeah? What do you do now?
So why go to college?
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I drink.
Give me a drag.
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
You got it all in your head?
I'm getting treatments right here.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Raw.
Oh, it's not bad.
No, why should I? It's yours.
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Well, what else does?
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
Yes, I'm glad.
What do you want to tell me?
Come here. Come on, now.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Nine ball.  Three ball.
You watch me.
I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
So do you, Fast Eddie.
No.
With them?
Yes.
I only protect myself -- !
I don't know.
What's inside?
I don't know.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
Yesterday.  They're back.  Haven't seen them for a few months.  I have to be careful.
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
I surrender --
That's fine.
Yes.
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
That's Mars.  The closest planet to us, now.  That's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
First lemme look at your necks.
I left it at work.
George, you're acting very strangely.
Can you tell me about that?
No.
They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
I have school.
They're from out of state.  Father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. I really don't know much about them.
It's really nice of you to help us.
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
Connie, don't hang up.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on.
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
He wasn't the President then.
David, you're drunk.
What'd I say?
It's not me. They're overriding the system.
You as well.
ETA with target; four minutes.
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Then find them.
We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
Yes, I am.
Oh. Sorry.
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
How to kiss ass.
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
I want the Vice President, Secretary of Defense, the whole Cabinet and the Joint Chiefs taken to a secured location. I'm staying here. I am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
And I am his.
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed. This will find a place of honor in our Spanish collection.
I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
I usually don't.
Don't know. Think of something.
I can reach it. I can reach it...
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
Look, can we discuss this later?
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
What final challenge?
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
I was the next man.
Hmmm... What did we talk about?
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
I know, Dad!
The penitent man. The penitent...
Who are you?
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
Something magical. A sacred rock.
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
Lao She.
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
You will go to palace there.
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
No. We pray to Krishna to help us find the stone. It was Krishna who made you fall from sky -- so you can got to Pankot Palace. To find sivalinga -- and bring back to us.
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
Their children?
A SNAKE!!
It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
What?!
Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to latch onto a good-looking, incredibly rich prince.
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
You're dreaming, Willie. You want to make it real, just knock on my door.
What -- the bug?
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
I'm coming, what's the rush?! Ohh! What's that?! There's stuff all over the floor! I can't see a thing!
A what?!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
I'm going down.
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
There's got to be another way out.
Not quite.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
Yes?
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
...I need to make a phone call.
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
Don't do it.  Don't aim at the head.
Hear voices don't I.
You're gonna explain.
I'll talk to them.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
No. Don't tell the guards.
You gotta help.
Thanks.
I'll sue.
What does it say.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Who did?
Gone where?
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
Nothing. You just do nothing.
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
I'll get in trouble.
I don't want to eat it.
Why not?
No...you idiot!
To the hotel. To register.
Without your pants.
Rene...
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Is something glinting?
This...is not going to work out.
Doesn't.
Are you serious?
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
How do you know?
Oh come on.
Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.
No. What will you do.
That's not funny.
What do I do?
It is a blank. This is no time for Zen.
A hard left. A hard left.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
I can't handle that thing.
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
Let us get to the border!
Then what?
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
It's a long story.
Rene?
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
Bit expensive, sir.
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
Join us.
It is to me too.
I think I've heard of you.
Why would we want to hurt you?
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
Whatever it is, don't do it.
Ahhh. Good choice, sir.
What do you want?
What did you say?
I didn't say anything.
Blake?
Oh...I can't. Business.
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
Can I help?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
They left. I had to go with them.
There's not much to tell.
He didn't.
What's he done?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
Then why are you smiling like that?
I asked him.
I said just relax. I'm in full control.
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
What'd...you forget?
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
It was my choice.
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
It wasn't me. It was him.
I know a nice island.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Thanks.
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Whoever took it does.
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
I heard them.
In the backyard.
How long?
Three hours.
You got a deal. 
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
We gotta hook up.
Oh, it's real selective... about as hard to get a hold of as the Manhattan phone book.
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
It's an alternate version. So what if we have an alternate version? And I don't think her being cautious is so damned unreasonable.
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
Catch ya' later.
Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
Catch you later.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
You ready...?
Right now?
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
Who's calling?
Yeah.
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Well, actually, no. Well, he's on the fence. That's the point.
Don't interpret that!  Hold it. Hold it. Hold it! Slow, slow!!  Sheikh, do you mind... if you would just turn your chair a little bit to face Mr. Wallace?
Ordinary people! Under extraordinary pressure, Mike. What the hell do you expect? Grace and consistency?
Good.
What?
I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
Did work.
How much would I get paid?
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
Makes you feel good? Putting what you know to use?
It's okay.
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
Words! While you've been dickin' around at fucking company golf tournaments, I been out in the world, giving my word and backing it up with action.
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
You mean... since this morning?
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
ABC Telemarketing Company.
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
You greased the rails!
You try and have a good time.
What?
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
Well, what do you really think, though?
Liane has filed for divorce...
Where you staying now?
I sent the document forward to Sandefur. I was told that we would continue to work on a substitute, we weren't going to remove it as it would impact sales, and that that was his decision.
Possibly, yes. That is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. That's right...
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
What?
Doyle Oil?  A Massey Pre-nup?  She loves him.
What?
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
Ruth Rabino.
Why do you think she did it?
Did you see the tape?
How do you know?
Gotcha.
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
But why him?
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
Thank you.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
What is it Miles?
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
Miles.
I bet.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
That's marriage.
Marylin?
I fell in love Miles.
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
I thought so.
Marylin.
My whole metabolism is -- off.
He was right, wasn't he?
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
Right.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
I don't have a pre-nup
Don't threaten me, Miles. I did nothing illegal.
Thank you.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
Is she going through with it?
Miles -- why so angry?
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
Do you have it?
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
Mother?
Who's "Patty."
When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said --  "When I grow up, I want to be divorced."
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if—
Come in. Sit down.
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
Yeah—with all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
Because marrying that fool King Westley is—
South America.
What've you got against King Westley?
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it!
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Stunt?
On the road.
No.
Ridiculous!
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that—
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
Oh—the papers—
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
That's none of your business.
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Oh, this?—I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me.  Behold the walls of Jericho![4] Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet.  Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
You've got a name, haven't you?
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Where is the shower?
Nope. No complaints.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Aren't you afraid of me?
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
You're crazy.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
You're prejudiced.
Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instance—a natural "piggy-backer."  Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family?  Why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that he—
I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
What!
All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
What's got into you?
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Try me.
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke—and hungry—and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this—  —with a follow through.
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Come on—get in.
What'd you give him for the car?
I love you.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?
Come here, you little fool!
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Do you know?
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
Isn't he here?
Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything.  Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .
But can't you wait until morning—
What's that?
Yes?
What time is it?
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office—unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
Free verse, huh?  What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
Get out!
Okay, pete. 
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
What?
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
Send it collect.
Hey, you!
What's the idea?
Say, Buddy–
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
I can use a smart guy like you.
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Why—no—
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Yes, you are.  Look we know Oswald didn't pull that trigger.  Castro did.  But if that comes out, there's gonna be a war, boy - millions of people are gonna die.  That's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison.  Goddammit, look at me when I talk to you!  You're too goddamn self- opinionated, now shut up.  If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours, listen to me.  Listen real hard.
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
And that's where you met Oswald for the first time?
To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
There's a word - orders.
Boss, are you calling the President a murderer?
Dave?
I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
I believe the boys got a couple.
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Who was paying you, Dave?
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
What?
I realize you're under a great deal of stress .. it's clouded your judgement.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
I wouldn't imagine where.
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
It's going to get worse, honey.
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
Take a look across the street.
"Once ONI, always ONI"?
Between six and seven seconds.
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
Allen Dulles?
You never got anyone killed, boss. Their actions killed them years before.  If we stopped now, it'd be even more wrong.
We need him back.
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
If you buy what you read in the paper.
Was he there often?
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
She's the best damn witness we have!
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
That sounds fun.
Uh huh.
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
You.
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
What?
Uh-huh.
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
Hey, Jackie.
She sound scared?
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
But you're not going to stop her?
Who do you think I am?
Can I see your I.D.?
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
What's your brand?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
Fifteen thousand.
I'm old enough to be her father.
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
You don't actually do it that way?
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
Has he hinted around?
What about you Max?
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
In a dress.
Why?
I'm sure.
Did you tell him you were leaving?
I know.
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
I thought you were tired of your business?
Then you don't see him for a few days?
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
How can you help us?
You two meet?
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
You talk to him?
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
We've been following Mr. Gara, and he's definitely working for Ordell.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
I'm sure that was the idea.
Uh-huh.
You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
What were you two fighting about?
I knew it.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
Baby, I didn't --
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
I'll give ya ten.
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
I was there, I saw her do it.
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
It's a diet thing?
So where did you go?
C'mon, don't lie.
That's a picture of me in Japan.
You been to Japan?
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
Whatcha watchin'?
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
Then put your goddam drawers on, and get your ass out here. I got somethin' to show you.
That was Beaumont.
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
What's your relationship?
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
Did you get it?
So what, you left her there.
Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
Then what?
We went to the parking lot.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Watcha gonna see?
Have fun.
They don't have your winning personality.
Where would you like me to put my ash?
You have it with you?
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
House or apartment?
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
I can see that. Why?
Oh, yeah? What did he do?
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
Hear what?
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
I'd like to hear that too. Turn around and put your hands on your head.
She's been there since Thursday night.
Uh-huh.
I know where to turn.
Yeah.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
You better be, motherfucker.
Take me home.
Hello, Sam.
Yeah, ever since that ...
Stop!!!!
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
What are you talking about?
There was a bang.
It's cold.
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
He told me he was going to Hell.
How long had that been going on?
Sarah.
She talk about the boys?
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
I don't want to know.
Jezebel, from the post office. You remember, you met her that time at the Christmas party. I was living with her. God, it was a nightmare. There were all these demons and I was on fire. Only I was burning from ice.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
Who did?
I moved the couch. That's all.
Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
No. Have you seen my glasses?
No. The little one.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
Gabe.
I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
They're like demons, Jez.
Come on. What were they, Jake?
If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
It's gone to the top.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
Lie down!
Hey, I'm not dressed.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
He did? When?
Why didn't you call me?
He said you didn't have one.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
I don't believe this.
Are you out of your mind?
Please.
Where have they gone?
You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
I'm not upset.
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
Oh?  Where you going?
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
You know who I am.
That's what they called it. A fast trip right down the ladder.  Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. But I don't need to tell you. You know.
Like it was yesterday.
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
It's strong stuff.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
That's a lie. My family was here.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
I work in a bakery.
What's wrong?
You in trouble?
They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
I don't know who they are, or what they are. But they're gonna get me and I'm scared, Jake. I'm so scared I can't do anything. I can't go to my sisters. I can't even go home.
Everywhere, like a plague.
They're monsters, Jake. We're both seein' 'em. There's gotta be a connection. Something.
Pause play.
No.
We made it?
Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
I don't know!
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
Not a chance.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
Yeah yeah. Got it.
I'm pulling, damnit!
Yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
He was chasing me!
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
You prefer an apple?
Jesus! Can't you knock?  Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.
Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
4You're not going anywhere.
Old Earth?
Just a favor for your old man.
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
Try some of this. I made it myself.
It's my charter. My party.
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
I don't want to depend on these things, y'know -– sometimes you can weaken your eyes.
Ow.  He's gotta be more careful in the water...
Love a cup of tea. With lemon.
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
Tell 'em I went fishin'!
So we should set out a smorgasbord?
I didn't agree to that!
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
No, it was local jurisdiction.
There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside.
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
I can't stand here doing nothing!
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
I didn't know her.
That wasn't funny.
So would I. Come on in.
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
This is Quint, Missus.
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
Thanks for the message.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Cool.
Charisma?
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
I'll try to drop by later.
I miss it too.
I always think you're cute. I think you're beautiful.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
No...
You know it's okay.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Can we make out now?
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I don't really know anything about it.
What is your job title, exactly?
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
You're kidding!
Junk?
Yeah?
You don't have to do that.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
Is Vanessa here?
Isn't that great? I got it when I was in Japan with my band. She reminds me of you.
I actually know this one.
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
Then what's going on?
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
No thank you. I'm off sex.
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
Yeah, she does.
Dad, no!
Tore up from the floor up?
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
Is this Juno?
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
You're not listening to me.
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
I just thought she'd look really old in real life.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
Are you looking for any other compensation?
They're yellow.
Ever since, it's just been like a ticking clock.
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
So you don't do any of those things.
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
Took 'em all.
No it is not!
Yeah.
I heard that.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
Early, sing me a song.
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
...I don't know.
Walter Livesy.
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...
What do you need a Bible for?
Now why is that?
Damn right I do.
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
Carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it.
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
I don't want to talk about it.
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
Why, what did he do?
You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
Everybody just shut up!
Without his car?
17.
Yes. Altogether.
With how many people?
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Was up bitch?
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
What?
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
How?
Right.
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
What do you want?
Get another forty.  Smoke a blunt.
Hell yeah. Fuckin' starvin'. Wait up a sec.
It is right.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated "Wonder Twins"!
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
No. Casper's right. Girls love it. They just act like they don't in front of their friends.
That.
So.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Right.
You are?
Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles.
Casper, where's Telly.
Where you goin' tonight?
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
I had a female vagina last night.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
Nothing?
Bang up stuff.
No, Fidget, I...
Because your a virgin?
Why is that?
Do you care about me?
One.
I'm sorry.
But I only had sex with Telly.
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
No. I just gotta go find him.
Do you know where he went?
Who, Benny's little sister?
Because he can like climax you up to that...
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
He still does.
I hate 'em.
No.
But then I won't need your money.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
Four-thirty in the morning?
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.
Chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  People have a lot of free time.  They like to gossip.
Yes.
Casual?  You were boning her weren't you?
No.
Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
How'd you get in here?
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
You're right, I can't make you do it. Besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the Franchise Tax Board anyway.
I don't know, but I think you're right. He's lying.
What was your relationship with her?
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
You're not going to tell me that.
Just like who?
What makes you think I was there?
The police haven't told you?
They think that you and I are doing this together.
I know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
Set up some pieces on the big board?
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
You're losing me.
Nice meeting you.
That has nothing to do with it.
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
How long has she been dead?
Six, eight hours tops.
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
What about the way he arranged the body?
I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
Meaning?
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
What did he mean by Huxley?
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
You know, I hate to say I told you so, but I warned her.  Coming home at all hours of the night.  A young girl new to the city.  This neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
Do you know how she found the apartment?
Maybe, but I don't think so.  I think it's just a tease.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
Sounds very violent.
Are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
No.  You were talking about chess.
What?  By attacking me?
No.
Then why are you backing up?
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
Me too.
If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
I can't wait either.
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
I have no extraordinary powers.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
What do you see?
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
Never.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
The Beast will kill her.
Use your sword.
You and I will guard the fire.
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
No.
I have a cinnamon bar.
You do?
Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
He will not come. You will be my queen.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
There's an Emerald Circle a few leagues from here.  We'll find her.
The Widow of the Web?
Her name is Death.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
But you would not stay with me.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
She was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
We had no children.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Of what?
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
Do you need money?
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
What?
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
...OK.  I love you anyway.
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
...Why didn't he close the window?
There are better things.  You see the importance of the "moment".  Ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. He'd have suffered it.  This way, he already departed. Without knowing.
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Huh, that's good!
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
...And how much is it?
Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
I'll kill you!
It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
I don't follow.
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
Don't be so sure.
Good.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
Not our problem.
P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
Out of the car.  He jumped out of the god damn car!
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
Making the grand total?
Umm, no.  It's just that --
Pulitzer, here I come.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
You were right.  From the heart is always better.
I was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I'm sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
Oh, that's not mine.
How are you feeling?
I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
No.  I won't take it unless I pay for it... Let's see, that's a pretty nice watch -- I can see that.
No.
Water?
Are you working?
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
Thank you. What time is it?
Yes.
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
Right... OK...
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
Do you want me not to go tonight?
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
Yes.
How much, do you think?
I don't know. I'll find out though.
I will keep you safe. We are both older.
That's right.
But it's a top three school --
I believe we are.
Sort of.
His dead body with a bullet in it.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
But you agreed last night. In the office? When we were discussing my "career"?
What?
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
No.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
What's the point?  Look at me.
Relation?
I'm her sister.
I know. He has it sent out.
Really?
Wow. I'm glad I met you.
But maybe it is --
I never trust a woman who's not blonde. Except for my friend Serena, but that's only because she's a blonde at heart. That's the whole reason I'm starting the Blonde Legal Defense Fund.
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
What?!
Are you asking me on a date?
What do you think?
What happened?
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
We're on our way to the bridal show in New York so we thought we'd rescue you from law school for the night.
You should. Do you have a resume?
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
East coast people are different.
Do anything exciting?
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
Yeah, luckily.
Pull up next to him!
Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
You go to lady now?
Like some vile toadstool.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
To be my bride, of course.
Why should I kill you?  A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
What do you want from me?
Oh, yes...
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
Or was it the time you and Jimmy Squarefoot stole the golden apples I'd forged.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
I fear she's lost.
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
Screwball!  You dolt!  I've a mind to change you into a toad.
Careful, lad.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed.  The Baron must have left a trail.
Aye.  And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Will you chance a miss?
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Ah, but you will.  And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
I could have struck off his head just now!
Sapphire!
I've not heard a note out of you.
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
I'll try.
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Three cheers for our champion.
Unicorn?
I'm not its master.
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet.  True royalty approaches.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
To fetch your napkin.
My father and the Baron.
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
He did run?
Good.  They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn.
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
What?
Sunlight... It destroys him.
Nor can I.  Damn!  It's buzzing all around me.  Ouch!  I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
How do I get the horn back?
She's dead!
I pray God grants it me.
No fear of that now.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
I'm promised to another!
Threats won't make me love you.  Tis not the way of the human heart.
And as barren of love as stone.
You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net.
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
The Black Baron, you say?
Nay.  Castle Couer de Noir is Devil's work... built with sorrow and grief...
We did a lot of the wiring too.
We can work.
Sam!
Oh.
No.
Is that legal?
Monday.
What are you doing here?
We're not gonna do anything.
Why are you so uptight?
I thought I was helping you.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
What?
He's at work while I'm here.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  Now she's just hostile.
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
You're here early today.
You'll have to explain that to the police.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
I'm not doing it!
It'll be fine.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
You'll have money when you work for it.
I don't know.
I might have a solution.
The gloves on the table are for you.
I'm not even listening.
How do you become something you're not?
I would have killed him.
After everything.
That's so weird...
What's wrong with your back?
You lied to me!
Good for you.
You know what mortise and tenon is?
Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
I need you to do me a favor.
She needs to be alone, I think.
He doesn't answer.
A blueprint spool.
Four days.  I left to think.
What did you do with your dog?
But you can't call me while you think?
I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
Do you remember?
Finished or unfinished?
My stupid back.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
You're a good mother.
It's not my back that's killing me.
No.
You got any weed?
Who?
That's the problem.
I feel in love with George again.
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
What did you say?
Dad said it first.
I just thought it would be nice.
Better make it a week.
It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Yeah...
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
She's alright, isn't she?
Why not?
Married?
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
I don't need the Baptists on my back, but I suppose I could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee.
As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers, boss.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
I don't see where that's any of your business.
No, tell me what's so funny.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
Bank teller's just a start. I got plans. Real plans. Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year I'll be a loan officer.
A loan officer?
My daddy gave me this watch.
Yeah? Who'd he steal it from?
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
Yeah, I want some pie.
There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
He's dead.
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
Claude.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
What do I want? What makes you think I want something?
My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet.
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
Does that mean I'm in?
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
Goodnight, Ray.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
I said you're soft.
So?
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
You heard what the man said! Move it!
Come on, old-timer, hook the brothers up.
Oh, right. Well, why didn't they get those pardons?
Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
It'll be too late.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight.
What difference does it make? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail for his killing? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal!
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Shoot him, Wilkins!
Jenny?
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
I hear a train coming. Drink.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
What do you think about... Earth?
It's our time, brother.
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
Well, let's rock and roll.
Release the evil?
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
I was just playing with you.
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
That's a pretty brassiere.
Beast.
I know, your wickedness.
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Peppermint... alright.
Really?
My dad's an optometrist.
Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
Why would you be floating?
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
East Rutherford.
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
No, for you! How old are you, Billy?
Your turn.
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
Fine... Holly will get you ready. You're in good hands, believe me.
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?
Well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  You know, Logan -- you wonder a lot. Too much for a Sandman.
Only a few? You're just not trying.
Did you ever see anybody renew?
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
Please... No.
Later.
K.
Of course --
That's nice.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
But what is this -- why?
Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
They won't listen.
We'll convince them.
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
I won't.
Is it inside the city?
No.
What people?
At least it's over...
I have always been here...
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
I don't think so.
Yeah.
This is our bedroom.
Yeah... Laurent.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
Me, too.
Okay.
I don't know.
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
Andy?
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
Oh, yeah?... What else?
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
Yeah.
What night is that?
The police called us.
Yeah? what did they want?
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
Yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  Mel, let's get Peter in here.
No.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
At your house. Don't you remember?
Does it say anything on the tape?
What night?
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
From the club. You didn't answer.
All right.
I wish I knew.
I thought there might be somebody inside.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
You will.
I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
At your house. Don't you remember?
I don't know.
You really don't remember?
I was?
What's the BITCH'S name?!
She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
Yes.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
I see.
I see.
Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
You never looked better in your life. As soon as our clothes are cleaned, they're going to give them back to us, Lovey.
Mr. Conway, I don't like this place. I don't like it. It's too mysterious.
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
You know, that's what makes the whole thing so funny. A guy like me starts out in life as a plumber - an ordinary, everyday, slew-footed plumber - and by the use of a little brains, mind you, he builds up a gigantic institution, employs thousands of people, becomes a great civic leader. And then the crash comes - and overnight he's the biggest crook the country ever had.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
Who, for instance?
Shall we go inside? I should so like to show you some of our rare treasures.
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Well, is it?
That's all very fine if it works out. A little amazing, of course.
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
I can't let him go alone. It's suicide!
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
Splendid!
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't—
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
Are you the High Lama?
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as—
How I'm going to bask in reflected glory!  People are going to point to me and say, "There goes George Conway - brother of the Foreign Secretary."
Yes.
I'm going to drag him out and force him to tell us what his game is.
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
I don't know.
Nothing about the porters yet?
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
Shhh!
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
Stay here?!  What's the matter with you, Bob? You've been acting strangely ever since we came here.  I've never seen you like this. Why can't we leave? What's stopping us?
So you think I'm mad?
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
You've got to talk about it. What about me? You said they stole that plane to bring you here. I didn't want to come. You owe me some responsibility.
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
I'd go mad!
Yes, the little Russian girl.
Come on! We're wasting time!
was saying—
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenly—
That fellow got on at Baskul.
What do you suggest?
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for long.
Bump?
Cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
And if I say yes?
For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
You do?
What?  I thought you just--
Kay, I'm sorry...
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
INS, Washington.  Special services.
DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.
Right.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
A what?
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
Do his job.
Kay!?
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
Kay.  Seriously.  What if he actually means what he says?
Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
Are you sure you don't?
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
Nothing.
How'd you know that?  Kay?
I don't think it's a tradeoff you really want to make.  Now give it to me-- I can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
So whattya say, kid?  You in or out?
Did it leave?
Can you see?
What?
Please --
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
Why?
Agatha, you're never going back there.
I am going back.  I see myself there.
Yeah --
Baltimore.  Eastside.  Solomon P. Eddie M.D.  I was a plastic surgeon.
Yes, you did.
You made those tapes...
They were performance pieces.
How do I find the --
I can't even stand up --
Organic microbots that reconstruct the nerves and blood vessels. It'll feel like fleas chewing on your eyeballs.  But whatever you do, don't scratch.
Not to mention, "Saved by the bell".
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
Uh, sir...
Yeah?  So?
Go back to work.  All of you.
Take your time.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
I need help with her.
That's right.
Uh, I'll try...
It's a little late for that.
Wanna hear something funny?
Once I even told him I loved him.
No.
If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
I'm... not... a... killer.
You can tell me how someone... could fake a prevision.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
Heal who?
I believe in that system...
Do you?  Really?
You shouldn't.  You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself.  Not the young federal agent who wants your job.  Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created.  Don't trust anyone.  Just find the Minority Report.
If... you have one.
We know why John was tagged.
No.  That's what everyone thinks.  John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
What?!
She's in the room with him when he kills Crow.  She's already a part of his future.
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
No.
Have you been there recently?
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.  Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.  That's why I left him.  And now you can leave.
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Not on me, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
Come on. Just tell me. It'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
Thank you, sir.
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
No.
We're in Fashion.
Should I fuck him?
Ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
Mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. Don't you like your pretty clothes?
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
I want spaghettis.
No. What kind of bachelor party?
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
I'll support you.
I want you to take her with you.
But what about them?
Yeah. Where is he?
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
Shit.
Brooklyn.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
Ricky's taken care of.
Where's Ricky.
I didn't say that.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
You want --
You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
Bobby.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Don't be shitty.
Hey, baby... Nothing. What are you doing...? Yeah, I'll probably cut out early...
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
You wanna go right now?
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
What are we delivering?
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
It's not even yours.
I like it.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
I'm not painting the fu --, I'm not painting the ashtray. And frogs aren't purple.
Who's driving her?
What's the movie?
Oh, I'll represent alright.
Yeah. He said that's our account with the car service.
Great. On my fucking room.
You think Maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? Why do you think he gave us all this bread? Or the number on the pager? We gotta represent him by showing some class. The man's got an operation. How does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
Look, man, I never met Ruiz, okay? I don't know what the fuck I'm picking up, what the fuck I'm dropping off, who the fuck I'm meeting. All I know is Maxie's still pissed at me cause I sold his fucking van.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
You got something to say --
I don't know.
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
About what?
Fuck this.
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I'm drunk.  Siddown, motherfucker.  'Sex and paychecks.'
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
We're not getting whacked.
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
I'm your soldier.
The what?
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
No more, man.
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
What do you mean 'kinda?'
The line's over there.
Cool. See you later.
Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
Stop.
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
You're from LA, right?
The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
Goodbye.
Edinburgh.
Keeps me out of the army.
Heard where?
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Frisk me, baby. Give me a real pat down.
Let 'em come. I'm ready.
I'll give you back the 600.
Yeah.
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
That's what Mama used to say.
What? Everybody knows God is White.
What for?
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Tell Him that.
There's nothing to talk about.
I can handle it.
Did you hear what I said?
I love you.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
You have to sleep for three.
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
That's enough, Brother Earl.
Let's get out of this cold.
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
Down front as always.
That's right.
What color were the original Hebrews?
I told you we don't know for certain.
Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
Allah Akbar.
Yes, sir, I did.
Shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till I explained what concurrently meant. It meant a minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the Charlestown State Prison. The date was February 1946. I wasn't quite 21. I had not yet begun to shave.
I do know I love you.
You better believe it.
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
The hell you are.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
I ain't doing bad.
Tell him about Baldy.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge?
I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible.
Believe it or not, you're safe here. The Judicial police will kill you. If they can.  This page?
All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[Why?]
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[Who killed her? You?]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[Do you know who I am?]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[Who's he?]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
I came to visit you.
I know. But which state?
I'm looking for potential.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Do you think he'll come back?
Maybe. Did you hear him?
Yes.
Did you used to?
It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
No.
Last night. Do you know something?
And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
She understands men.
I'm trying, mom.
He's like a great big bear.  'Creasy bear'...
She's young. She'll get over it.
I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
[We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
Two tourists who never went home.
And they took that away.
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Which one was that?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Down there. That little one there.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
We just talked.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
She wasn't so bad.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
I'm thirty-four.
Thank you.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
Yes, I know.
Come on inna dining room.
Maybe that would be a good idea.
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
We just live one flight up.
Okay.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
I'm stag.
Oh, no! She died right in the hospital...
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, boy he can write.
You're the accountant inna family, and I figure you might know about these things. My boss wantsa sell his shop to me. His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. He wants five thousand dollars down, although I think I can knock him downa four...
No, listen, that's my mother, I'm gonna pay for her...
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
Ma! Leave me alone!
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
What nurses?
Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
Hello, Thomas.
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
Tommy...
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
Hey, that's great, Henry! Good thinking!
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
Same general idea.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
He can't take much more time on the table.
So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
We think the same way.
It's supper time.  But you're not hungry are you?
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Come clean with us, Frank. Were you on this religious kick back home, or did you start to crack up here on the post?
Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
The Painless Pole plans to cross the Great Divide tonight and we need your help to straighten him out.
No, no, that one.
What do we do?
He can move in here with us.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
Our minds?
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
Yes, Reverend?
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
They missed the boat.
Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed.  You still working the trains?
That's about the only thing I don't do – that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
Homosexuality.
I don't think so either.
I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
Sir?
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Oh, get out of here!
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
What's that, Henry?
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
Are you all right?
He likes you well enough to stick around.
With all of it?
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think—
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Yeah, that's the one.
Money.
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
And, Miss Mitchell—I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
A third party?
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
Oh!
We'll get a handwriting expert to—  What!
Well, you're catching on.
I wish he had a family, though.
Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
Take it easy, John Doe.
Awwwww!
Well, nobody asked yuh.
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
Have you seen him?
Yeah, a little.
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
Who's got him?
Who?
Who are they?
Sure.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does!  Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
Huh? Get what?
I think maybe you'd better. And Connell—I'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
How?
Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people—they ought to run you out of the country—and I hope they do it!
Thanks.
She isn't?
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a—
Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you make—and it's all written out for you.
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
SWAT wants to go in.
Dinner's on you.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...  They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
How can I help you with the particles?
It's not just the particles man, it's the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. It's been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
You want a convertible or hardtop?
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
That's right.
Being faxed over now.
Good. I won't be armed. We gotta operate on trust here. We're going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.
If you say so.
How do you feel after a shooting.
Furthest point I could find from New York.
You don't like New York?
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
I'm not sure.
I don't gamble.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
No.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
You're a compulsive gambler?
So what do you want?... An autograph.
We lost.
How much you wanna bet?
Is it always like this?
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
Greg.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
You got a bet on the game tonight?
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
For the last week things have been going pretty well between us. I think we've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
Yeah, I could get used to this Paradise shit.
I've been thinking.
Here comes the wire... and... Backtrack gets up in the last jump. Cozy girl a very game second.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
The car is part of the deal.
And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...
I need to take back what's mine.
Yes.
-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
It's all been transferred.
From the dream.
True.  But why?
So wrong --
Yes...
The woman you're stuck on.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
What?
It's not used for anything.
Listen to yourself.  Digitization.  You know that officially that's a pure fantasy --
-- Who did he digitize?!
To hide the evidence.
-- You told me.
You weren't real.

I've never been this sore in my life.
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
Thank you, Dulcea.  For everything.
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
Ryan's Comet!!
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
LET'S DO IT!?
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
No, Al. Whatever we say. We're all Bosses here. We don' need another.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
I must be going.
You got something to hide?
It's too late.
Have you thought about this?
Guess I'm too confused to think.
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
So what is the problem?
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
Like a party for all our friends.
I'll do fine.
Ben-jamin.
They don't give a shit about us!
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
A mother-fuckin' peace conference.
But that's an hour's drive.
Couple hands. No harm in it.
So? I'll get Bugs ta do it.
The name's Charlie.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
I found that out.
That's why I'm here.
No worry, Charlie. I will kill them for you. No one will know.
The terms will be mine.
And what do you want out of this?
Wanna know what I think?
Hell. It's been four days!
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Guess so. Ya got a minute? I got somethin' for ya.
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one did you fall in love with?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Well - you'd need a body.
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
YOU SET ME UP!!
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
Are you okay??
When'd you get in?
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
I'm good.
I'd love to.
What does he do?
I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
Moscow.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Would you settle for a husband?
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
You know--little worms--ambition.
Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
You play--left field.
Yeah. What about the second act?
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Yeah.
*All right*, then. After all, what's it to me? So they *drop* him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
I'll cherish ya.
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
Where?
My first name's--Clarissa.
Okay--I mean--
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
What!
Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every paper. They're tossing out everything that comes in over the wires!
What is it?
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
We're waiting, Hubert.
No wonder--without your dinner.
Oh! Go away.
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
Me! Jim--how--?
You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten Thumbs, I'll be on my way to Washington in half an hour. Whatever happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger of yours. Never mind how. You'll get your instructions from Ken Allen here. It isn't anything you have to do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You just use your *high office* to help him get it done. Understand?
The--head?
What stuff?
Emma!
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
Why, of course.
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
My pigeons--I better see about my pigeons.
Saunders said--this whole thing was *his* idea to get graft--!
For a question!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
Yes, I was--
Nonsense, Jeff.
Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man called Taylor got to do with this?
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've *got* to come!
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Just fine.
*No*!
Most natural thing in the world!
Convene?
Tonight.
How?
Committee.
Why?
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Since sixteen or so.
It hasn't been easy, has it?
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
Great.
Already? All these letters?
Do you want to dictate them?
Oh--*Saunders*!
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
Saunders--!
I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've got me licked.
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
Funnier things have happened. Ma says when Pa was courting her, he acted strange for months. Didn't make sense--or anything. And one day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, so help me, you talk like a man whose collar is too tight to bear." "Not the collar, Mary," he said, "my shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma said, "Take the pesky things off!" Which Pa did, an' they were engaged within a week.
I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
What do you mean? What's going on?
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
Listen, Joe--at least--after a day like this--I got one good bust coming before I start showing him monuments--
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you!
I meant it for one. I meant--Sam Foley couldn't get along without you-- and neither can I at the moment--
What do you mean?
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
What are you talking about? What difference--?
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
You won't stand for it?
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
It's crucifying him--!
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Will Senator Smith yield to--?
--to avoid bringing disgrace upon a clean and honorable State!
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
No!
No! I resigned last week!
Yes, but I—
What's that got to do with it?
What?
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
What's that?
Oh, that—
The drums. He taught me to play some.
All right.
Are you? When?
In a day or so, I think.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
Can I have a month's vacation?
With pay!
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
I wish you luck, sir.
I wanna see that guy!
Proceed.
Mr. Cedar!
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney—
You can't?
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
No, thanks.
No, thanks.
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
Are those stories true?
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Shut up!
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
Naturally.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Ja.
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
Oh. That.
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
South Dakota - north?
Is she home?
Thank you so much. Good night.
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
What two policemen?
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
Me, sir?
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Oh, for god's sake, Phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! Are we listening to Lionel now?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
Go to hell.
No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
Nope.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
What do you think's wrong with her?
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Don't need it.
We're going for a walk.
What?
Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
And he's where?
You like it?
Either one.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
Yeah?
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
I don't know if --
Of course.
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion...  ...that I am in love with you.
Sofie...
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
You probably got the idea.
What?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
True. Should we stop them?
Really?
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
Don't you like this?
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Well, there's Lily.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
Did you carry a gun?
You were messed up, man.
You and Candy...?
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
You're not going to kill us?
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Do you know where I can steal some?
Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
Twenty.
Broad?!
Yes, well...  I know my brother.
Twenty-five percent, and not one single farthing more.
I know my treasure.
Preparation for what?
For entering the afterlife.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
No you're not.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
There goes that belief again. Not me, I am outta here!
I have no choice.
Alright, good, that's good. I like this fellow, like him very much.
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Well neither do I, thank you.
Shut-up and get me off of here!
Read the inscription on the cover!
What's it look like!?
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and taste worse, but that's the best the desert has to offer.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
Fantasizing... about you.
Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
Do I?
So who killed him?
I can't.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
Should I kill them?
You're nuts.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Terrific.
I thought you'd chickened out on me.
Why?
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
My heart died a long time ago.
It is not dead. It is hiding.
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
There's a vague similarity.
A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
No one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by the bus station.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
Looking for... the TV Guide.
Mother... it's not what you think!
And why are you wearing that silly costume?
Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
Or both.
May the forks be with us!
Ah -- you approve?
I think it's absolutely charming.
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
Things are quite serious, I should say.
Cavalry?
There are none here.
You could have them here by daybreak.
I'm not insulted.
Paris has surrendered?!  I don't believe it.
And where is Joseph?
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
No, sir, none at all.
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
Are you trying to insult me?
Well, you shall see.
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Oh, you must forgive me, General Bonaparte, I'm afraid you will think me incredibly stupid but I know absolutely nothing about this. Eugene is so independent -- he hardly tells me anything any more, and he has so many things in his room, I must confess I wasn't even aware that he had this sword -- you know how boys can be!
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
Why did you give it to him?
You couldn't face telling me what?
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
Oh, then you are...
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
What I am talking about is moderation.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Let me have it.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
You paid cash?
Thank you.  I only got two bullets in the mothafucka, but it's better than nothing.
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
Not me.
Come on, Day, try it.  For moms.
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
I can't taste nothing.
What?
Fuuuuuuck -- U!
Ain't no windows in here.
I don't know yet.
How you know?  It could be anything.
I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry to hear that.
What it smell like?
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
Smokin' what?
Excuse me?
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
Why did he go in the house?
And some rolling papers.
Ya'll live around here?
Okay, later, bro.  Hey, Craig, nice smokin' wit'cha.
What urgent message?
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
What you doing to my nephew?
Aw, no lovin' tonight?
But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
You just come in on Amtrack?
Uh, yes..
Yes?
That's right.
You were very nervous.
Believe me, I don't blame you.  This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.
I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
Then I have time for a drink.
No, please...
Forget about it.
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
Let' s do it.
No, kisses to...
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
I've done much better ones than this.
Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.
Shut up.
It's time. It's time now.
Do it!
Hm!
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --
Not even her?
I will guard Pearl with my life...
Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
Hide us Uncle Birdie! He's a-comin' with his knife!
She went.
They hid in a broom closet!
Mother, I only --
All to pieces!
She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
'Cause you're too little.
To see Dad?
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Dead. 
I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from Parkersburg!
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
You think you can make me tell! But I won't! I won't! I won't!
I don't know nothin'!
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
All right.
It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
A scrawl. On a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
I was praying.
Harry, what --
Yes.
My flesh and blood!
When did I ever?
This man down at the Drugstore...
Please, Nancy. Trust us.
Haven't slept, have you?
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
The killer.
How you plan to do that?
And you'll be here to catch him, right?
Like Rod Lane?
Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
School.
I will.
To bed with you, c'mon.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
What are you serving?
It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
Which part of the room is mine?
But, Comrades...
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
The former Duchess!
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
That's all right.
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
I don't feel like any breakfast.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
Have you?
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
It is only a small table but it will be no trouble to put in some extra chairs.
What is it, my boy?
If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.
...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
I think she covered you with the parasites.
Two thousand francs.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
We did it with the best intentions...
We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
I think so too.
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
You're welcome.
You might hold this for me.
And where are we?
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohème... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
He takes good care of that.
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
That is correct.
Thank you.
You repeat yourself.
Don't do it, please.
You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
You analyze everything out of existence. You analyze me out of existence. I won't let you. Love is not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? Why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? Why do flowers open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka, Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?
No, that was restful. Again.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
I don't like your following me.
Then how did you get here?
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
What?
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
No! No!
I know... it's the Russian soul.
Much happier.
No, no music.
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
Please.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
Those newspaper people?
Oh, Leon!
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Yes, Swana.
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
No... please...
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.
What?
In that case I can only say good-by.
You leave me no choice.
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch à la Père Mathieu. 
Where do you eat?
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
My jewels?!
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
He told me to take you to his conference room.
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
Sirica's just trying to force one of them to testify.  But they're solid.
I like that.  That's a solution.
Good.  You know how I feel about loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of my people go to jail.  That I promise you.  The important thing is to keep this away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman. I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I have complete confidence in you.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
You think this is just about politics?
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Jesus!  Through a window?
Sure.  Lyndon, JFK, FDR -- I mean, Truman cut the shit out of my investigation of Hiss back in '48.
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
Yeah, good old Spiro.  Well, better him than me.  What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
We are covering up!  For some petty, stupid shit.  There are things I can say -- when other people say them, they'd be lies. But when I say them nobody believes me anyway ...
You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people.  No one I know feels ... close to you.
A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected. I still got the South and Goldwater and his boys.  I'll take my chances with the Senate.
And if I stay?
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
All right.
Just do what I say, Bob.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
Run 'em over.
You're talking too much about black Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with the rednecks.
Don't let it lose us the right-wing vote ...
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
For God's sake, when does this end?!
Why me?
Harold may have lost touch with his Bible, but thou must never lapse.
What'd you say?
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Yes ...
What?
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
So President Kennedy thought.
Would you walk with me down to the paddock?  I'd like to look at the horses for the eighth.
I'm trying to spare you an embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on his way back here.
I know ...
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
We took his system out.
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
The White House.
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
I didn't ask what your staff thinks, Henry.  What do you think?
... because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I have never made a dime from public service ...
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Free, if you're the president.
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
What the hell -- I love her.  And she's great in bed.
Mr. Nixon.
Yes, I understand that.
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
Compassionate.  Grateful.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
I don't want them to love me.
This.  Above all.
Anything.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
You're a long way from Whittier.
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
You're drunk!
Lost.
The "crises"?
You heard it?
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
How come're you doin that?
You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
Try "old" on for size.
Yessir. It may be that. In a nutshell.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
He's real all right.
Some pretty bad people.
He can take all comers.
You sure?
Sheriff?
I don't know. He ought to...
Well I don't either!
Yessir. It was punched out.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
No.
At the gettin' place.
What? Quit hollerin'.
Just keep it up.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Well -- how come?
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Hey.
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
What's that.
Where does he work?
In the truck.  I'll get it.
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
Yessir.
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
You said that.
You've lived here all your life?
You married into it.
I don't know. I couldn't say.
Call it?
No.
There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
Okay.
No sir, it's unusual.
Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here.
Let's just call it square.
That's not an answer.
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
I do like you.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
Not that way.
I'm a welder.
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
Yes.
Could I have that in American?
...plenty
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
Did you send anyone out there?
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
Tell him what you told me.
Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
You know, flags and shit... he said "for a livelier look" or something.
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
I'd rather not...
...what're you saying?
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear?  Fine...
Oh, Betty --
What?
The LeSabre!
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Yes, she is.
What's so special about it?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
I'll go to the Hospital.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
He has no heartbeat!
The Five?
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
We need someone with the right kind of experience, Lonnie.
Really. And where was that, old man?
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?
I... I don't know...
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
Now, that's really stupid.
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
What doesn't?
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
It just didn't fit her profile...
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
What do you mean?
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
I don't know, George...
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.
Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
Mr. Campbell?
Our pleasure, Big Dan.
Waitaminute -
You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
Hang on there -
You mis'able little sneak thief...
Good Lord, what do we do?
Fire! I hate fire!
Not that I'm aware.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
But I don't mind telling you, I'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end...
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
So I borrowed it till I did know!
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly behavior. Just lucky we left before they came for us.
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Well that all depends. You boys do Negro songs?
Soggy Bottom Boys - I don't precisely recollect, uh -
Well he's the reform candidate, Daddy.
Well I guess folks don't mind they's integrated.
Blooey!
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come.
I joined the Navy.
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
Yes, sir!
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
I called you Sarge.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Louder!
Yes, sir!
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
He was. He died.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Everything was different.
I haven't made up my mind.
No! That's not true!
And you turned him down??
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I've seen all that a hundred times.
When I'm good and ready.
No, they're for your mom.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet.
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
No problem, but who's Susan?
But it can't wait.
Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself.
There is not one thing funny here.
The fuck did you do that for?!
That's right.
Please...
You got an idea?
You finish.  Then we finish.
The kid in here.  The other two when we come out.
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
Shut up and let me think.
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
Shit!
Hey.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
Master closet.
No fucking way.
No cars.  Feet are faster.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
The furniture guy?
Shaky?
Nope.
Shhh...
What?
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
I hear you. Alright. I'll go, you stay.
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
Like, you Inspector Brimmer are not going to be sitting in your car anymore. I think it's time for a more active type of involvement.
Fuck how they operate. Just do it. like your man says, "By any means necessary."
Yeah, it's me.
Look this is bull...
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
Can you make a deal with them?
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
Cut the crap, you've been taking the man's money for years. Now it's time you earned it.
Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the Black community. It's their power base...
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
We're like policing the police.
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
I'm down.
They were empty...
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
And who is we?
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
All of the above, man...  And then some.
Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but...
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
Yeah... cop hit me...
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
Uh... uh... I...
He's not making light.
He's my father.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
Apology accepted.
Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
Colonel will do.
As you wish.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
That one is a bit more difficult.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
As long as your soldiers attack civilians, I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement.  And my men are excellent marksmen.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
Sir.
The middle colonies?
And the Governor?
You're in no condition to ride.
I have no choice, I...
What?
I know.
Seven homes along the Black River so far...
That's right.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
I understood him to be a Patriot as well.
I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
We saw.
Where is he now?
When?
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
Thank you.
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
Yes, he does.
Earned.
That bad?
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
I'm glad I killed them... I'm glad...
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
Yaay!
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
Of course I will.
To remember.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
You believe in it.
Don't bother. I'm coming home.
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
I'm not climbing that.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
Ayuh.
This time I mean it.
Because it's right.
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
I will.
You can't.  I can.
He didn't waste it.
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
Aye, for us there is.
Now.  No, don't kill him.
And he's got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you!
No.  But him I believe.  He us genuinely angry.
Did you, now?
He said you say that!  He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
You're right.  Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it.  The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition.
First -- have you found me a crew?
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
Smith.
Ah, but you have heard of me.
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
I'll slip in, talk them into to come out, and you'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them.
Where does it make berth?
Because you're a pirate.
Agreed!
You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
Barbossa.
On what?
This way!
You haven't seen it.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
Do you know what I see?  I see man making his own clouds.  I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a site that makes my heart sing.
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
You think you can use me to stop the meltdown.
No.  I'm getting used to it.
It's ready now, I know it is.
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
You're right.  Place a call to our friends at the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.
Icarus, please!  This is important!
Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant.  And we're going to need a containment crew.
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
Yeah.  But it wasn't a group.  It was one man.
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
Okay.
Like Crazy Glue?
So, I guess it worked.
Right.  You predicted it.
Am I?  Look!  Right there!  That's exactly what I am talking about.
Susan, this is the future of America here.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
Yes.
Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
No, no, I just feel wired!
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Means?  Oh no.  We won't know what it means until the end of the story and maybe then it won't seem quite as funny to you, Doctor Frankenstein!
You have no one to blame but yourself.
I don't know.
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
Getting used to it.
Where is it?
You mean he's polymerized, like me?
The same thing I suppose.
The question is, are you?
Don't worry, four eyes.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Exactly.
How-di-do.
Gallagher!
Are you crazy?
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
That's ridiculous.
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
Oh, man!
Is that so?
We were classmates.
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about—
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Yeah?
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
That's so.
A what?
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
Araby?
No?
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see—'  Tweet, tweet - ha, ha—
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
I beg your pardon, sir?
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
—and that—
Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
It's the smoke.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
I dyed one and washed the other.
Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.
Must be my wife.
Been where?
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh?  Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake!  Now, as a Smith to a Smythe—
Me, sir?
No, sir!
Found no skeletons?
Yes, sir.
Yes.
That's all I wanted to know!
Very good, sir.
It doesn't matter.
Okay.
In my handbag.
Bud?
She's crying.
No she's not.
But you can't go out there.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Sure you are.
No I'm not sweetie.
Where are you gonna go?
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
I think ... I might be ill ...
What are you doing?
What's the matter?
Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
Real rain?
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
It was accessible to everyone.
I'm not lying ... Here I'll show you.
The other one?
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
To who?
Does he--you know--like "me"?
It's in your closet.
They don't notice that kind of thing.
Really? It seems so fattening.
It's fine.
The pages filled in?
Yeah ...
Right here.
And you're sure about this?
Oh ... Right.
Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
Mmmm.  Boy. It's hot up here.
Real rain?
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
What the hell's going on!
WAIT A MINUTE!!
Excuse me?
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
I'm so glad you're here.
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Yeah. TV busted?
Yeah ...
Hey.
I don't know...I mean: I don't know.
Why?
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
I'm sorry.
It's fine, but --
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
You're so scared.
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
I just want to know where she's staying.
-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
Nothing.
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
...just talking to you....
Really?
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
She's...not here...she went out. She went out of town, she travels a lot.
Does Jack like to Jack Off?
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
Me?
Yeah.
Really? Please?
I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....
I was wondering if it's better to ask your girlfriend for the money? It could be really easy. I mean, I have all your information, credit card information and billing stuff --
We got disconnected before....
I need help.
Should I just ask your girlfriend?  Maybe I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?
This is not cool.
It was cool last night.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
They don't get opened until eight.
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Not very well.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
I think that'll be fine.
Ok.
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
You see?
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
...yes I did...?
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
I don't freak out.
Lena?
It's so nice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's right you travel so much.
You left me at the hospital.
On my knife.
I know.
Hi, is this your first time calling?
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
Fine, thank you.
You ok?
...I'll tell you later.
This is a bunch of bullshit.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
What time are you gonna be there?
I won't.
I'll see you there.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
No.
I'm pleased to have the new post, sir.
No one's forcing you to listen.
Now give the signal.
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw.
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
You always do.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
THEN BUGGER ME!
Valcour. His chair.
-- water! --
Coulmier, you animal!
NOW STRIP.
Your wig. Remove your wig.
So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not?
-- the passion in your heart --
AND DID YOU?
Go to hell!
Why was it you never took her by force?
Was it impotence?
NEVER!
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
Of course.
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
He's sworn to obedience.
I have.
-- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse --
You'd suffer in her stead?
And my own.
Quite.
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
There's something else I want from you.
Is it awfully violent?
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband.  Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
Don't insult me with your cute press quotes Save it for Louella.
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
Do you?
Uh-hub.
There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw, to hell with you!
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
Don't
It's not really--
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
This picture--
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
There's a different between want and
But why? Just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!
The drinking.
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
No -- no -- I mean--
That's right
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
We're doing Hearst.
Fuck you--
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
What?
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
I just can't . . see it anymore
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
Mank!
Face it, Orson, they're gonna hate it. I told you, not enough closeups and too many scenes with a bunch of New York actors.
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
Excuse me, I hope this isn't rude, but aren't you Marion Davies?
You're lying to me.
We already made the same offer to the stockholders.
Yes
Get out
Again.
Then we'll open it in Detroit or Dallas or Kalamazoo for God's sake! We'll show it in goddamn circus tents and--!
It was a -joke, George
No, we're jake. But listen-
I don't want to sit
Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
I'm Christ
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
Nothing...
I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
Hit me in the face.
Jack, I got no gloves.
Jack! Enough!
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
Yeah, she's nice.
You wasn't with her?
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
We did what we had to do. Tommy don't forget. Sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if Tommy don't die.
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now.
I tell you what. You hit me here.  Sugar Ray hits me here.  I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
What?
You asleep?
What did I say?
Positive.
You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want.
All I did...
Jake...
I called. You weren't there.
I went to the movies.
Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
What're you talking about?
Yeah --
Why don't you just call him up?
No, not that.
Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.
No. Open the door.
Excuse me for living.
I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
He has it. Thank you.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
Do that.
I think they missed their chance with her.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
Your logic is backward.
Your Lisa?
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
I don't know what you mean.
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
That's abnormal.
She's just not the girl for me.
She's only perfect.
Depends one which one.
And some man will lose his.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
What?
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
Smart girl.
Yes.
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Anything else bothering you?
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
That's good news.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Yes.
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
I mean what I said.
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
125 West Ninth Street.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
I do?
Thank you.
But you're not?
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window. 
How?
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Chelsea 2-5598.
A new disease.
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
Give me some dirt.
Chicken?
Buzz Gundersen.
We got to do something.  Don't we?
Any other entrance?
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
Well--
Will you wait a minute?
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
Where did you get the gun?
In my mother's drawer.
No.  I don't think so--
You scared?
No.  In the morning.
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
Judy.
No.  I'm scared.
Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
Get away from me!
Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
You sure?
You trust me, don't you?  Just give it to me for a second.
It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
Leave me alone.
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Bully for you.
Yeah--why--
You were looking for me, weren't you?
No--I was just--maybe--
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
See, we're very modern.
Should we explore?
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
Yes.  My best friend.
What?
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
I'll never get close to anybody.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
No.  Why?
Read a lot about you, Nick.
Please, Gabriel, don't...
Toys for... adults?
Saw me --
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
NICK!
Nick --
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
I love you, Nick...
We'll need one.
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
Merry Christmas.
But I never said Rudy.
Yes!
Why not.
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
Get out.
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
You need six.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
GO!!!
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
Fuckin' freezing.
Hell yeah. You work here long?
How do we take them out?
It's a roach, guy --
There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
And some pecan pie.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Aw, Rudy.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
GUARD!!!
No, man! No, no, no!
...be with her...
And you set me up.
Do what?
But... I had a five...
There is no other table --
No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
You ain't dying, he is.
What? Nobody set anybody up.
The cops were there waitin' for us!
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
Yeah.
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
What for?
You can do some crazy things with it.
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
Sure.
Take a seat.
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
I tried that once, it don't work. You get four guys fighting over who's gonna be Mr. Black. Since nobody knows anybody else, nobody wants to back down. So forget it, I pick. Be thankful you're not Mr. Yellow.
What do you care?
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
Don't ask me that.
I'm not askin', I'm betting.
Freddy Newendyke.
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Down to my car.
You didn't ask.
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
I'm okay.
Joe.
Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
I don't believe in it.
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
What?
For all I know, you're the rat.
I think he's just passed out.
Well Joe ain't gettin' here. We're on our own. Now, I don't know a goddamn body who can help him, so if you know somebody, call 'em.
I told him where I was from a few days ago. It was just a casual conversation.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
That fuckin did it!
Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit...  And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy...  And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Not these guys.
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
Nobody. The light was bad.
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
I'll make the soap myself.
Why do you think?
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
I haven't got the job yet.
Which ranch?
A man I used to know.
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
All right. I'll tell you.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
I don't care what she asked you.
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
What's there to be fair about?
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
And you're all alone.
Go ahead.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
Maybe in Sonora.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
I don't care what he thinks.
Where is he?
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Then I know my alphabet.
I feel good anyways.
But you're his brother.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Hey, I have an idea...
Ray, have you been here all this time?
You sure?
Okay.
No. I never date outside my race.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
It looks like the furnace.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Yes...
Great!!!
No. Keep rubbing.
Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
I know, but I've been thinking --
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Come on. We better get you cleaned up.
What, you think I did this to myself?
But he'll kill her!
Thanks. I made them by hand.
Um, I'm not touching anything.
Just wait, you'll see.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Soon, but first I must bless this house.
You better go get Dwight and the Professor.
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
What's this?
How are we going to get them all up there?
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
Remember, Dwight, not a word to anyone.
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
What is it, Dwight?
That's why we came here, remember?
You do.
That's right.
Okay, give me my belt.
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
Hi, Mrs. Sutphin.
Mother? 
She wouldn't...
You said you hated him.
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Let me see!
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. 
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
That's right.
Ooohhhh!
Amen to that.  It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
I certainly did.
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
...Browsing.
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
Bon Appetit!
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
I thought you told me you didn't know where she was.
You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
"The Dante?"
She's a pretty good sort.
I guess most people are.
I ought to know.
She showed me a drawing.
He was a kind little man in his way —— and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
The people at the restaurant?
Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I think I can be more frank with you. I don't believe you. I still can't understand the reason for such a wild tale. It's like some of Jacqueline's stories.
There is a very simple way. Got a telephone book?
We've tried so long to find her.
You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
I'm afraid.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
And you knew he'd be here.
But you're always at the library.
I don't think that's so revealing.
Some time before those nice white gloves are dry you're going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
It's because of Jacqueline —— I can't go on looking for her --
What's wrong, Mary?
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
But you should make her laugh, Jason. Come, make jokes for her. I'll bring your food to their table.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
But why come to me?
Because there was another girl— years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -— I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
Perhaps
I don't know.
But you would like to know where she is?
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
Have you any other relatives, Mary?
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
Yes?
Oh.
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Well... well, the cliché about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
No.
Aren't you?
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
Who's Donna?
Donna?
Why not?
About sex?
You just ask them questions?
This is just... so...
Yes, I do.
Why not?
What do you have to do to get ready?
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
Can't or won't?
What was the problem?
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
But I don't understand --
I don't know. Possibly.
Like maybe a big part?
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
But I'm not.
Yes.
Not very often.
You bitch. I knew it.
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
What upsets you about that?
Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently.
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
Why?
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
Why not?
Well, why?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Because I wanted to.
I wanted him to see me.
No, but I did.
You are in trouble.
Why?
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
Hold on.
Bye.
Do I know you?
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
Nope.
Whichever you prefer.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
Were you disappointed?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
He doesn't have to tell me.
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
No.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
She's there? What's she doing there?
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
What do you mean?
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
I know. Will you please leave now?
Maybe I don't want to leave. Maybe I want to talk.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Really. How'd it go?
What tapes?
You know which tapes! Where are they?
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
One moment.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Medical clinic?
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
I hit it. I hit it with my cane. Then I carry it on the cane and I throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
We live in 703.
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
You know and I know that Hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? Lousy. Dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. But he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. Could he get grants for crazy projects?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
Fools!
I tell you what's cooking.  She made the blind see and it was a gift!  Who was it from?  Let's hear an 'F" for...
I got it!  I got it!!!
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
So it seems.
SOLD??!!
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
Who trusts experts?
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things?
That doesn't make sense.
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
No...couldn't I do this later?
F for...
YOU'RE NO GOOD
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
We're not confused.
Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean from "One Life to Live"?
I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
And?
You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
Highliner.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
They're just leftovers.
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
Not so bad yourself.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!
Just tell me.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
That's a good age.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
I'd rather have a knife.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
Let me call Christine.
Just a minute!
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
It does. Feels right.
She is very hot.
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
She works for tips!
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
I want to go home now.
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
Okay! Fuck!
Bathroom.
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
What're you drinking?
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
Understanding of what?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
What? Of course I like Christine.
Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
You're an asshole.
Huh.
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
Throw me his ball.
I don't want to talk about it.
I SAID OKAY?
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
Let me use your phone.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
I'll pay for it.
Yeah.  Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Fine. Just slipped.  This is my blood.
She got anything good?
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it.  Right now. Hurry up...
A paper?
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
Victoria.
Miles?
See you over there, Miles.
Both.
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
Where?
I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
A hair.
Don't touch him.
My ballet recital.
That's weird.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, "No." He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it.
From what?
Me too.
How do they know it's over?
A mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. It's eleven now.  They're leaving. Beat.
Have they said anything about our area?
Yes.
I have some upstairs.
It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
I just asked his name.
What's two?
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
The money's in my saddlebags over there, but I ain't stepping out to get it.
What do you mean, the horses?
Your next water ain't for three days.
It was my fault.
Someplace safe. How you feeling?
So far that's all I seen in this life.
She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
Have you thought at all about your plans?
Goodbye?
This is a brutal land.
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
Ten A.M.
I haven't done anything.
I had to get up anyway.
I expect.
It's not going to be easy.
Why?
Half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
The problem is, Emmett, you killed the wrong McKendrick.
I'm worried what he's going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
We didn't get that far.
He'll be here.
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
You can't do this.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
Who did it?
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
Because they enjoy it.
Did you hear his son is still around?
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
You've got a legitimate job.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
You're right.
You didn't tell me you owned a saloon.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
Who?
I'm glad we talked.
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Even the fall from the plane.
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
-- I can explain.
Really?
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
Not if I don't let her.
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
No... it's life.
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Listen to what you're saying, mom. Is there any evidence she is?
Yes, call me Simone.
Clyde.
For her?
For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
I have your new leading lady...  ... right here in my pants.
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
Hello, sweetheart.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
This week anyhow.
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
Really?  Too bad.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
She did... didn't she?
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
I could get the death penalty.
What?!
It's a yacht.
She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.
What do you want -- ?
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
You're in breach.
I never apologized properly for what happened on "Sunrise".
You could play the lead.
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't I...?  Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him.  I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.
Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
You hate him?
I don't know. I was just thinking the same thing.
If we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?
Yes.
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
What do you want more than anything?
I don't know.
You weren't a paper champion.
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
Where will you go, where no one has died?
And you know what else?
What?
A lady. She died.
They?
They want me to do things for them.
She wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
J. C. Penny's?
Two.. maybe three days.
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
Pardon?
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
I'm not surprised. It's got a body count of zero. And no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
Who? Us?!
You got something against farm people, Keith?
Fuck you! Fuck all of you! I'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- And drinking moonshine with Johnny Cash! Senior AND Junior!
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
Yeah?
What are --
-- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"?
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
Suzie --
Never.
No. What…?
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
It's my nature.
Just block the doors, any way you can.
The problem, Starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was Grant.
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Howdy, Mr. Grant. You goin' to the Deer Cheer this weekend?
How many you need?
Out.
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
My present?
It's just one of my students, Grant.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
Your what?
Who'd want to?
An existentialist.
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Like what?
Uh-oh.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
Hey...
You gotta admire the man's determination.
I'm begging.
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
But I still don't think...
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
You okay?
Let's boogie.
My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Now, you just find him, son.
Is your security team armed?
You think so?
Your attitude sucks.
Then why are you still looking at me like I'm asking for the square root of something! What did you say!?
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
That's Mecklen. The deal's closing. I can pick that phone up and I can work this out.  You'll walk with me.
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
-- this isn't a swap meet Morrey, they're getting Sparazza and the west coast syndicate, giftwrapped, now if that's not good enough --
Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that...
Yes. The actual contract went to Lazlo Soot, the man that plunged to his death from the Penthouse yesterday. He was to neutralize Israel's entourage and prep for the removal of his heart. Ingstrom was to handle the surgery itself on-site with the assistance of Dr. Gregory Gill, Israel's personal physician, who was also on the Sparazza payroll.
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
Yeah... Sid?
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
True?
Like a mafucka.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on some other scrub. We got one another, s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
Fuck you.
Security's locking down the elevators.
What else did Padiche say?
Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
All right.
If it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
How?
Why, who did you see?
-- we are not sure of that.  We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
Who are you trying to convince?
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
To calm your anxiety.
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
Let's go home.
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
I think so.
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
Those are dreams.
Rheya.
He is.  But he was here...
It's all right.
I love you.
Chris --
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me.  It's at home.
Queens... You know Queens?
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
How did you know?
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
And "is"...?
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
Yeah.  I liked being around you too... Claire.
I do care about you!
What do you want to do?
Oh that thing in Queens.
Pretty bad.
I know.
... Don't explain.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Claire...
The gun?  It's in the upstairs closet.
Sure we are, let's go!
Too kinky.
My ass is falling.  It is.
It's not your taste.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
I'm not saying it's your fault.
El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.  And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...
Me neither.
Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
Does it make you... hard?
Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
Is she injured?
I don't really see what that has to do with...
Bullshit!  Prove it.
What the fuck you doin'?!
Lay back, Mack!!  What's this "lay back, Mack?"  Where does he get this?
Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down, I say!
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
What if the world ends tomorrow?
How very dull, Peter Parker.
I-- uh--
I'm sure you kept warm.
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Why?
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Any sign of our friend?
I'll introduce you.
Yes.  Do you have a date?
Tofu.  Ben, I wish you wouldn't.
Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
Only Octavius knows for sure.  And last time I spoke to him, he was on the planet Whiz-Bang.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
Just drop me off here.
No, but I've got this secret identity to worry about. I'll swing the rest of the way.
No, no!  Not there!
Is you all little Adolfs?
That'll do.
In this barracks?
You make my mouth water.
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Don't wear it out!
You are talking crazy!
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
You won't get off that cheap.
What are the chances busting out of here?
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
How long is temporarily? I trust not until July.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
And this?
You want Betty Grable!
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
She'll never forgive me!
Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
Why, sure!
This is me, Animal! It's Harry Shapiro!
No. I want to draw.
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
The one you are hiding in the barrack, don't you know? The one your friend without the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
A little weak today.
Are we boring you?
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
Don't you know? Because I got my own ideas.  Let's have that civilian stuff.
What's the decoy?
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
At ease! He also says, quote: All you sack rats better show up for the services and no bull from anybody. Unquote. At ease! Monday afternoon a sailboat race will be held at the cesspool. See Oscar Rudolph of Barrack 7 if you want to enter a yacht. Next: Jack Cushingham and Larry Blake will play Frank deNotta and Mike Cohen for the pinochle championship of the camp.
Give this to Joey, will you?
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
The Germans know where Dunbar is.
We have no radio.
All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself. Now let's see.
Who's the guy, Schulz?
I do not want those cigarettes.
A chicken?
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
Really? What do you feel?
You get what?
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
Can I?
Yes, where would you go?
I hadn't planned on it.
That's right.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
I always do.
What's normal?
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
Aye, sir.
Lock phasers and return fire!
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
Tractor beam, aye!
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
Underground deposit?
A photon tube...!
Short range scan.
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
That may be difficult...
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
I still don't...
I'll go...
None that I can detect, sir.
Precautionary, Mr. Chekov. Shields up...
What? What are you saying?
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
You would have done the same for me.
The ship... Out of danger...?
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
About a dozen officers and men.
With some on the planet...
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Any time.
Who I am is not important. That I have them is.  I will let you speak to them.
No.
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
But -- why?
... Or the one.
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
What you ask is difficult.
What I have done, I had to do.
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
Station!
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
From yourself, Admiral.
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor. Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed. Please prepare to deliver Genesis to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.
Jim please --
Who --
Starfleet has kept the peace for a hundred years, I cannot and will not subscribe to your interpretation of this event.
Ssssh!
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
You can't!
Mainly.  And also that I'm proud -- very proud -- to be your son.
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
Inoperative.
I shall avenge you --
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you want, I'll have myself beamed aboard. All I ask is that you spare my crew.
Aye, sir.
We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
A few shots, sir.
Admiral, this is Spock.
Yes, we've been through death and life together.
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
Yes.
The power of creation --
That's it?
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Yes --
Spock...!
In my quarters, Uhura.
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
I did not think so.
You're bothered by your performance on the <u>Kobayashi Maru</u>.
They just don't want us going in there.
Stop engines.
By the book...
I exaggerated.
I do this because I was there,
I would accept that as an axiom.
Humans make illogical decisions...
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
Why don't I?
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
Would you prefer to do nothing?
That's crazy!
Come on, Pavel...
Not me, Bones... They did it.
That is what I said, Doctor.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
We're out of control -- Rig for collision...
... It gives me a great sense of history.
Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
No, <u>my</u> name.
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
Iowa.
It's his way.
... You're very perceptive.
Who do you think I am?
Noon tomorrow...?!
So. There we are.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
You need me.
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
How do you know this...?
... Simple logic.
Why not?
I see.
The hell I can't
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
They did, Admiral.
Then... Where the hell are we?
I will, Admiral.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
I'll try, sir. Scott out.  Well now, he's got himself in a bit of a snit, don't he.
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
Your vessel did destroy U.S.S. Grissom. Your men did kill Kirk's son. Do you deny these events?
Do you have the right to murder?
Well, that's different.
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Just use the keyboard...
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Tell her I feel fine...
Data, if you were following the boy and discovered this ship...
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be?  But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't.
More questions. Always the explorer. If you stay long enough, that'll change.
Will it?
There are caves in those mountains.
This way!
I aspire to be more than I am.
Sometimes I do.
Why not...?
No one's ever asked me that before.
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
Yes. But look at this medscan...
Is it safe to move her?
How about a passive radiation scan?
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
Planet's population. Six hundred people. You want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home.
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
Deploy the collector.
Do you have everything you need from command?
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
It may not last after we leave. If not, I just wanted, before we go...  I've never actually seen a sunrise.
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
Options?
As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
They have an incredible clarity of perception, Captain. I've never encountered a species with such mental discipline...
Why was Data assigned?
What are they interested in...?
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over.  Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
Where's the Sphere?
You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
Where?
I have the password right here.
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
Phoenix to control.  Initiating five minute countdown... mark.
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
As they used to say... all systems are go.
I'm on it...
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Yes.
Something wrong with that?
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try again.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
We're trying to repair Doctor Cochrane's ship. It's been damaged and --
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
Where? And don't tell me San Francisco...
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
That's impossible.
Fire.
Aye, sir.
We're still in Earth orbit.
Can't tell. Long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
Understood!
We've lost Bridge control!
There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless.
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
What kind of message?
Fascinating...
Speak for yourself. One day... one night...
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
More than ever.
No way.  You see this?
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
Retire.
You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
Well, I -
I know what you mean...
Shields up, Captain --?
What ARE we searching for, Mr. Spock?
Is that wise, sir? I mean, given their situation -  Aye, sir.
There's gotta be a way out of this place...
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
I always wanted to try that.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
Surely not.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon ship that's bringing Chancellor Gorkon here, and escort him safely through Federation space.
You have personally -
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
From Enterprise?
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
I always assumed Hamlet meant death.
Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
... I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
I want this ship searched from bow to stern. Lieutenant Saavik, you are in charge. Start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...
If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency.  There’s no crying in Starfleet.
Well... it seems we're truly sailing into the unknown. Keep at it. Anything you can give me would be appreciated. Dismissed.
Affirmative, sir. Negative, sir. They have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals.
Well then... only one way to go.
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
He would deny a "human" connection is possible. He considers himself entirely Reman.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
I aspire, sir. To be better than I am. The B-9 does not. Nor does Shinzon.
This isn't about me anymore.
Uncharted. We'll have to get closer for a more detailed scan.
Theories?
We’ve got him!
New Praetor?
There's more... as always. He's Reman.
Understood.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
There'll be another after me. And another after that. You'll find we're a resilient species.
What sort of signature?
Not yet, Mister Worf.
Captain!
A coup d'etat?
It's working.
She's the most beautiful ship I’ve ever seen.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
Anything.
Praetor Shinzon?
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.  There's so much we have to talk about.
You know I need to verify this.
As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.
Yes. The eyes have it.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
I have no reason to.
Yes.
I'm honored to think I might someday speak with such eloquence.
I was lonely...
I see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.
I see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a Starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. I see the man I will never be.
On my way.
Find her again.
You don't have to understand.
Sure.
No.
It is beautiful.
He's got a gun!!
Stay right there...
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Don't... don't do this... please...
Dashboard.
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
You. Mouth closed.
You didn't even see it.
No.
When we get here.
Eh... yes...
Why?
You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
The car will stop?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
The cook.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
Horses.
No.
You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
No.
Hey buddy... let her go...
What? No, of course not.
Give it a rest, Lyman.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter.
Can you see under the faceplate?
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
What're you going to do?
Jesus.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break.
Tonight.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
Tell me.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
Exactly anything.  Whatever you want.  Whoever you want to be.  Fabri, get us another round, would you.
Thanks, Max.
He records himself raping and killing her--
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
Jesus!
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
What else you got?
Who was just here?
I always do.
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
I do mean it.  And I mean this... if Faith stays you go away and never come back. You scuttle back into your cockroach hole and never cross my vision again.  You understand?
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
Are you sure it's real?
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
I need to see more... get more detail.  Something.  I feel his presence, so strong...
But that doesn't add, does it.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
Something in your car...
It's okay, Lenny  They'd never get here in time anyway.
Fire's out, isn't it?
I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
There's a plus side?
I guess.
Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.
Take the tape to the cops.
Besides that.
Zorro. Yes, ran it through my files, even asked around: came up completely blank. Thought there might be a Mexico connection, El Paso and all, but nothing. Fooled around with the letter "Z," turned it on it's side, got "N" -- there Ng, he's Vietnamese. The only thing that came to mind was zero, not Zorro. Remember Suspect Zero?
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
This isn't in our database?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
What?
Not bad, huh?
Yes.
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
I was lucky to find, much less crack, the address code -- no way to be sure I could have done it again.
Go ahead.
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
I don't believe this.
How long ago?
Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
You have to save this boy. Good exists in this world. I can prove it because you can, in your life, save this one person.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
We did find these, however.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
What's that?
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
And you're working with him?
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
Yes, sir.
Suspect Zero?
So you went underground?
And who else did I find? Agent Thomas Mackelway, crackerjack FBI techie. I was greatly disappointed when you were re-assigned.
I already have an employer.
If you won't do it for me, do it for your cousin, Nadine, right? The girl in the pink sweater.
You? You went by the book?
Whatever happened to MyDick?
Something came up, Murman, my man.
[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
[Not the heart, the watch.]
[What does the file say?]
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
I like working for the Bureau, sir. I like catching bad guys. It's all I care about.
Hope you never do. At first it feels like a sauna, by the time you hit victim four it's a fucking burning shirt factory.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
You're money, baby.
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
You better pay the man.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
How was it hard?
To do what?
I don't know... To grow, to go out. Whatever you want.
Mike...
Oh. You know.
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
...piece of shit. Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East.
Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and then I'll ask what she looks like.  Then I'll ask if we fucked. How's that, Tee? Is that "the money"?
You haven't told then, huh?
No.
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
Well, no harm done. This is Lisa. I'm sorry, I never got your names...
He is so sweet.
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
Well, who represents you back east?
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
It's a rebound.
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
No, no. Hold on.
That's okay. I wanted to talk to you.
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
So I don't call either way.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
No problem.
Look, there's not much of a call for Shakespeare in this town.
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
I didn't want to say anything.
Oh no?
I'll give you an eight. 
It's one of these. For some reason, cool bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Him?
I got to at least try once.
No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
...He's derivative...
I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
Wow, I guess you were home... 
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
I don't know...
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
Vegas.
Whu?
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Yea, how much?
Let's just leave.
That's bullshit.
...Baby...
Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
Yes!
What?
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
He drives a carriage.
Aww... He got away?
You looked right at her, baby.
You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you?
I know she liked me. I mean, it's not like I wanted to do anything with her tonight.
Chelios to Roenick...!
That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
Now go over there and get those digits.
You're money.
...it's definitely on.
Be smart about it.
...Okay, two...
You owe the Don a service.  In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help.  Be there to greet him.  If you have any objections speak now, and I'll inform him.
America has been good to me...
OK, OK.  You gonna make me something to eat at least?
Ba Fa Goulle.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
What percentages for my family?
No.
It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
Maybe I can help.
I'm going to finish school.
Good.  When you are finished, come and talk to me.  I have hopes for you.
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
You look good, too.
Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't want to hear this.  This is not a personal thing, this is Business.
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
Okay, but just tell him this is one favor I can't give.  But he should try me again on anything else.
Let's say now that we have to kill McCluskey.  We'll clear that up through our Newspaper contacts later.
Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I love you.
How do you do.
My brother, Tom Hagen.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
Oh Michael.
Don't you want dinner first?
Let HER ask.
Don't ask me.
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
What?
One of them fingered the old man.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
Until the old man tells me different.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
You think I scam?
Sure. Any time.
No, I like him.
Yes please!
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
It's just an undercoat. 
I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the old bastard is here right now! That's brilliant! How do you know him?
No, I think your mother, her illness --
And Rome.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
Relax.
I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to like everything about the way you live. It's one big love affair. If you knew my life back home in New York...
Oh God, I don't think so.
How?
Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?
What are you doing?
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Tom. How are you? You look well.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't identify himself because he was jumping someone else's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car. The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman.
He's not a man, he's a god.
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
What?
What?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Okay then, you're crazy.
Exactly. 10.30 -- 
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
I've thought about you.
I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer.
Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf? 
I can't later.
Tell him I have a fiancée, Dickie has a fiancée and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
Or Tom and Peter even.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
What do you mean lied about who you are?
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
How much to get a permit to carry?
Nah. I ain't interested.
You want to canvass?
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
Just people people, you know. Just people.  Had a dead man once.
The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdos in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
I don't follow music much. I'd like to though.  Honest.
I'm getting a taxi.
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
More people watch it.
Alright, now. You want to know why CBS has the highest ratings? You think their news is any different from NBC, ABC? It's all the same news. Same stories. Same order usually. What, you thought they had good news for people, right? You thought that's why people watched CBS? I'll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it.
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
The cops and company raise hell they find out.
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
Nah.  I suppose not.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
I don't like my real name.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
You can do it in my mouth.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
Why not?
I... I don't get along with people like that.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
What's so important?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
You're not much with girls, are you?
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
Why, thank you Travis.
Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess. Flush it out.
Physical? Criminal?
Well then check back tomorrow.
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
Funny, you don't look hip. 
What's going on?
Yeah?
Yeah?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Real down.
Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
Wrong.
Now they only have three rockets left.
All I know is that whatever you did, you don't deserve to go back.
I am, too.
Delly?  In here.
I had it, a minute ago...
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
Do you have the...
... and It's just... well, deja vu.
What?
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
No.  But...
But what?
"It's a Wonderful Life."
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Ah.  Luke.  Luke.  I like it.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Who... are they?
You bet.
... what?
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
Anybody take it?
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
I wanna close up soon.  C'mon, let's call her.
No, sir.
I... no, I... I just can't...
Aren't you coming?
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is.  "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters.  Now, did you go to any meetings?
Exactly.
You can't testify.
"Ashes To Ashes?"
Yes.  Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
Peter, don't let that stop you all of a sudden.
No, of course not, why should you be sorry?  You're the new Peter Appleton.  You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that.  Very noble.
No thanks.
I can play the piano?
No.
Of course.
The customers?  I don't know...
The war...
Yes.  Very.
All right.  All right.  We'll see.
Yes?
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
Yes.
Yes, I did.
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Yes.
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand.  You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
Take them.
Your brother told me.
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
I don't know yet.
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party.
Did you put the cover on that cage, Mom?
The little Brenner girl.
Where does he live?
I see. How do I get down there?
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Daniels.
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
It's nothing.
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
Lovebirds, I see.
Yes.
I know, Mother.
I got them all, Mother.
Oh, my God, look at her!
I know you can.  But I'd like to.
If they are?
I started to say... inside...
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
Yes.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Would you like me to go for her?
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Sixty...  Oh.
I said I wonder if you could help me.
Lovebirds.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
What made it...
What kind of law?
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
You like me, huh?
Famished.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
What did it say?
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
Why?
I told you what happened in Rome!
But not for me.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
Last night? What do you mean?
I'll get it.
Are you staying?
I think I should, don't you?
Really? Tell me about it.
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
Melanie...
Have we still got power?
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Mitch...
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road.  Are you ready?
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Well, all right, but...
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
No one called it a war!
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
I'm not sure, but...
Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.
We need them.
Of course.
I want you to help my little girl.
I'm only a student.
Ask this one favor --
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding? Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that I must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
Come -- it's a chance to try out your bedside manner, Fettes.  Take a look at the child.
I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
I remember her.
Now you run off and see that pretty Mrs. Marsh and explain to her.
Pulse?
Hold that lamp up -- I must see her face.
You'll be a good doctor.  I know all about doctors.
Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name.  Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too.  But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
I am the best man for the job.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
No.
You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those things. Look --
It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
What did you hear?
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
Where the fuck did you come from?
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
The scar.
There is no scar. I'm telling you.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
And he's right over there by the way.  What did you do to your face?
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
So you're going to kill him?
I don't know. I found him lying there.
Yeah, we do.
Christ. It was Corvis. Tommy Leonard was right.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
It's not that. Really. It's just... now that he's gone, I think it's time.
What a brilliant idea. I never would have thought of it.
That's good, Hilda. I'm glad.
I leave that in your hands.
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Professor Barnhardt.
Aw, gee, Mom -- I had plans to play with Mr. Carpenter.
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
Department of Commerce. She's a secretary.  They have a man they call the Secretary, but he isn't at all. My mother's a real secretary.  Mr. Carpenter -- now can we go see the space ship?
We can scare him more than he can scare us.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
Just Klaatu.
The present situation?
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
Believe me, you don't understand. They wouldn't sit down at the same table.
Thank you... Have you any news?
Now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the President
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
The boss is leaving for Chicago tomorrow. If I could tell him I was getting married -- with two dependents--
Come on in.
What about him?
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
May I see you for a minute?
May I walk out with you?
I want to know what he told you last night.
Where is the meeting going to be?
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
Yeah.
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
We are awesome monster-bashers!
The meanest!
You're eating maggots.  How do they taste?
Why?  They're only noodles.
Where's Star, David?!
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
Yeah.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
You think you're cool, don't you? You think you know what's really happening, don't you?  Well, you don't know shit, buddy.
To free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
I told Max eight o'clock.
No, I just like to read the <u>T.V.</u> <u>Guide</u>.  Read the <u>T.V. Guide</u>, you don't need a T.V...
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
Oh, no, you won't.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
What's that smell?
Ocean air!
Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us.
So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
Can we get a T.V.?
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
He's already gone to bed.
I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
Oh, right.  I always gets those two confused.
I hope so.
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
Yes... and I'm to blame for it. If you hadn't met me... if I hadn't liked you... I tried to warn you...
Why not?
So do I!
No.  Why?
Wanna go to the comic book store?
No.  On the phone.
Don't turn on the light.
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
The Marines.
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
Let's load 'em.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
... You think this Thing wants to become an animal?  Dogs can't make it 1000 miles to the sea.  No skua gulls to imitate this time of year... No penguins this far inland... Don't you understand?!  It wanted to become us!
What?
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
Hell no.
No.  The generator.  You got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. Get to it.  Where's the damn flashlight?  You fellas okay over there?
What for?
We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
What do you mean "you think so?"
Neither will we.
Enough, MacReady!
Didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them.
In this weather?
When was the last time you used it?
After all this mess.
How far's that?
Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
Don't let up, Childs!
Extinguishers.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
The journey is part of my work.
On the towers?
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
Kalen... hold on a minute.
Yes.
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Yes.
Trust me... You don't want to see any more.
This has to end.
I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
Why would you let me go back?
Because the past is immutable. Frozen.  Dead... And you are the past.
A man can change his history.
I'm a foolish man.
Because...
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
Why is it -- breaking up?
Admiration?  My my.
I mean... well... affection.
Trust me...
Holding you... again.
We took a walk three days ago.
It's only a machine.
Do you know you were humming?
You sound like my father...
No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
Yes...
That machine --
More than 800,000 years.
Yes!
And this is your "work"?
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
What are you?
How do you decide?
Yes.
Go back to your own time?
I could...
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
What's the matter with -- ?  -- What would I do without you, Mrs. Watchit?
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
Do they?
What are your people called?
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
We have to go after them, find where -- !
Kalen, look at me.  There's no one here but us.  You see... I'm here, you're here, Alexander's here. There are no Morlocks.  It was just a dream...
We never should have done this to him...
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
How?
Because...because you came out and said something you couldn't have possibly have known. You came back and repeated three names...
You may have known my father, William Starks.
They should just be looking harder.
Good.
No, it hasn't.
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
I'll leave. But look at me. Look at my face, Jackie. I'm not lying. I met you and your mother. I told you then that I'd lost my memory. [Beat] There was no one for miles around so I know you know there's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around.
I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
William, you're not making sense.
No, he didn't.
Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
No. I don't want it to.
Well, what time is it?
The future doesn't look different?
NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me!
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
[Beat] Thanks.
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
I don't know, but I think part of it's...
So you never knew your mother?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
In the leg.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
How are things goin' out there?
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
Human nature.  I'm majoring in behavioral science.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
A regular outlaw.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it.  Can you help me?
Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't I bring it to you?  For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
Not yet.
Can't it go to any office?
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
No, honey.  I told him I was buyin' a car.  What is it for?
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Then what?!  What, goddamnit, Louise!  Where the fuck are you going?  Are you just leaving for fucking ever?  What, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?!
Why now, Jimmy?
'Cause, Louise.  I don't want to lose you.  And for some reason I get the feelin' you're about to split. Permanently.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
Then what difference does it make if we stop?  Come on.  I never get to do stuff like this.
Isn't this fun?
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate!  You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
Ready when you are.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
Have another drink, Thelma.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
You left that guy alone in the room?
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
What happened?
What for?
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
Why not?!
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
You know those little dogs you see people with?
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
Now, Thelma, that is not...
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
Sorry!
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
Yup.
Oh.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Hi there!  You alright?
Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
No, I just meant...
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Why not?
I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world.
What?
And this adversely affects me how...?
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
Big time.
You said it, mister.  I gotta go.
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
That sounds like fun.
Here you go.  What's that smell?
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Warren!
Any idea where I might start looking?
You can't be serious.
Nope. Never been.
Four kids, three different guys.
She's in a wheelchair?!
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
Four.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Two million copies it sold last year. Two million, man. But not next year -- my idea's gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:  Seven-Minute Abs.
I'd go with the seven.
No I'm not.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Puffy, get over here.
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
Thanks a lot, Ted.
Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year, in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.
Yeah, sure.
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Okay.
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
I wish.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
I mean is it... is it...?
Everything okay here? Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
I wasn't trying --
So what's up?
Bye, Ted.
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Tomorrow...
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
So now you've got to talk him out of it. And then we've got to figure out an acceptable political solution.
And if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution?
No it isn't. They don't trust the people that feel this way. But these people are right. And the Kennedys are wrong.  We need you to tell 'em, Kenny. They'll listen to you.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
48 hours. In 48 hours there can be no deals.
General, the Joint Chiefs have just signaled our intent to escalate to the Soviets. You have signaled an escalation which I had no wish to signal, and which I did not approve.
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
Back to work.
I was, you bastard.
There've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them.
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
You're scared to cancel on Daly.
They want this fucking job, they can have it. It's no great joy to me.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Sioux Indian, right?
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
The agents who have worked out here say its like going into Nam. Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, foreign customs... and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds. They hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here.
Ray.
Beats the hell outta me.
Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
I already did.
I've got the doer. I know who he is.
Let's see it.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
-- Cooch. Woh. Stop.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
Cuz I want New York.
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
He says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
And...
She's your sister?
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
A what?
Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
Never mind.
No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
What the fuck you talkin' about?
And on to a bigger one with you?
I'm with someone.
I was inverted.
What would?
Too aggressive?
What are you talking about?
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.

You're horrible
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
Are you really that brave?
I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
What?
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
That's what I want.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
That's three.
We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...
Right on the flight line?
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
He's pissing me off!
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
Not anymore.
Okay, okay.
BREAKING LEFT!
What are you talking about, we gotta go!
The plane is fine.
Got you here.
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
Look, Ma, top of the world!
Come on, relax...
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
SHIT!!
You saved our lives. You did it!
I think I can work it out on my own.
Just below ten thousand.
NOT ONLY THAT, BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN. NICE GOING.
Three guesses.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
The wings..
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
I called your house.
Not something they tell dependents.
What was that?  An accident?
You're getting off to an early start.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
Don't be modest.  Kuato's dead; the Resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
Yes, sir.
Hmmm.  And how do you like your women?
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
Not since you lost him.
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
You went to Rekall, remember?
I did?
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
Let me buy you a drink.
Up to the right.
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Poor baby.  This is getting to be an obsession.
I don't know.
You know I do.
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
You went to those brain butchers?!
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
And falling in love?
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
Aaah, let me tantalize you.  You're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  People are trying to kill you left and right. You meet a beautiful, exotic woman...
This is too weird.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Get out!
The reactor.
The one in the mine!
Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door.  "Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain."
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
No problem.  Nice meeting you. Hope you get it sorted out.
The mountains are solid granite. We'd be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to Bixby if we have to.
Howdy, Rhonda.
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Has a lot of rain.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
I am not!
You got <u>that</u> right!
Little sons of bitches.
Right.
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
Jesus.  It's slower than hell.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
I want to live for the three days.
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
Yeah, geography.
Correct.
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
"We"?
You can't remember that -- !
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
-- What?
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look --
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
Screw you too, Kitty.
I killed the motherfucker.
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
Well I know that you're innocent, Shu -- even if you forgot.
Shu Kai Kim.
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
I hope so, Mr. Reynard.
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
For control of the prison drug trade?
What is your rank within La Compania?
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
You're describing half the high school girls in America.  What is she doing right now?
Go away. I am not talking to you.
Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Well, where are you going?
God damn, you people are confusing.
Was there an argument?
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
Stanley, I heard all about it.
Tell me about the letter.
Someone else has it now.
What do you mean?
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
That's good.
I don't know, Sam.
We're not. You and I are going to get some food.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
I'll get my kit.
Thanks.
When?
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
Oh god, Laura.
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
If I can smoke it.
Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
You mean Fred and Ginger?
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long.  They all knew you at that place.
WE got it back, that's all.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
But I love you, Laura.
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
Bob.
Oh, yes... yes...
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
James...
No.
What are you afraid of? What people think?
Fish eyes?
We throw away the whole head.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Good night, sweetheart.
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
We're late to get to your mother.
Yes.
Look at this finger here.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
How do you know what she doesn't like?
As if I didn't know.
There's no one here.
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
Yes.
I... yes.
I thought I would need it.
No.
Neurology?
What book is that?
Objection.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Yes.
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
I completely understand...
Hold on a second.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Yes... I... yes.
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
'Code Blue'...
Yes.
...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony...
Hi. How are you doing?
Yes.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
I believe that's the law... is it not, Mr. Galvin...?
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy. We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end. Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
Really. How wonderful for you.
And are they going to get it?
You're talking like a drunk.
Yes.
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
Stop pressuring me...
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
This is Miss Costello...?
Kathy Price.
No.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
What do you want?
...I'm going to need your help...
I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help.  Mick, will you help me...?  Will you help me...?
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
You use their witness.
The Doctors.
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
She told me.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Yes, the roving nurse...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.  And they resume seven minutes...
Huh. And why is that?
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
We'd be in all the papers!
Don't you live at home?
I feel like I did one time when I was small.  Awful scared and lonesome...I'd wandered off - I've forgotten why - but the family and whole crowds of neighbors were hunting for me.  They found me in a church.  I was afraid to go in any place else.
Are they sure it's a meteor?  It didn't come down like one.
So is the town, I notice!
It was nearer than that.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
What?
I'm sorry.  At least we're in on piece.
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
Like Freddy.
Heather, has there been another call?
Diabetes?
These look quite fresh.
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
You have a fever, sweetie?
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Not sleepy.
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
Steady...
Yes?
I think of it as sort of a nightmare in progress.
You know damn well it's more than that now!  How can we stop him?
Now?
Sounds good.  Kim, would you get Heather and me a coffee?  How you like it, Hon?
I am about this.
Guilty.
We were idealists.
Claiming their place in the world.
Fifteen.
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
What do you mean?
I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
Her name.  Bregitta.  It's poetry.
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
Why then.
He does.
Well that's just typical isn't it?
Me too.
Maybe it's an air raid.
Do what?
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
Speak up boy!
The fact is... We'd like you to give Phil another chance.
Close the door.  Sit down.
Of what?
They send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.
He's a big boy.
You're officer of the watch, George.
Trust me donut.  I know.
On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
I don't have to listen to this.
Outer.
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
About anything.
I'm sorry...
Then what are you trying to say then?
That's not what Skipper thought.  He was trying to spill air from the main!
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
How old are you?
Twenty.
You was in the Marines, huh?
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested?
Whattaya mean family?
Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
Sailor... Lula loves you.
But I'm wild at heart.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
I will, Marietta. Goodbye now.
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
What?
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
Peanut...
Stab it and steer.
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin'. Seems to me the government could do somethin' about it. One of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
She got me an abortion...
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
You mean like pedal pushers?
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
We oughta stay somewhere outta the way. Not in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six. If Johnnie Farragut's on our trail he'll check those first.
One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
You got me, peanut.
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
What was this one?
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
One bad car accident...
I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Yeah?
Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
Oughta make 'em happy.
I mean tomorrow.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
How can you say that, Sailor?
What makes sense, is all.
I'll bet.
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
What if I asked you not to?
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Have it your way... But you want it.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Explain it... I told you.
Yes.
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
On one condition...
Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
Please Santos... Where's Johnnie?
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
What?...
Whattya mean?
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Life is unpredictable.
I ain't heard of nothin'.
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
He's right, you look horrible.
You're welcome.
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
Left you...? Who? Emily?
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
What's to tell?
Hey, I heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the China town thing -- and I believe you, okay? That's why we're here. Now go get dressed.
It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
So what's the problem?
The Chancellor's here? Now?
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
...we find the jacket.
I don't think so. In my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
You need to see a doctor, Mr. Tripp. An internist. And I think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
No, really...
Shoot.
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
So what are you doing out here?
So I'm told.
You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
Yes. Well. It's complicated, James. I think we should go now.
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
You?
Does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
Miss Sloviak's.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Is he all right?
Mmrrmmm... KNAP SAP!
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
The hell I am.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
Yes you did. Last night. To your friend Crabtree. "Is he any good?" he said. And you said: "Not yet he isn't." I heard you myself.
It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
Me? Sure. Why?
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
That good, huh?
I'm pregnant.
She's left before...
Has he asked to see the book yet?
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
Really? That was fast.
I'm kidding. Hello?
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
Inside.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I know, but sometimes...
Terry was telling me about you on the plane. It was all so interesting.
Tony. Now that I'm home.
He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of a...
I... I...
I'm in love with your wife.
Sara. I'm in love with her.
Only when I'm working.
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
I'm not going to stalk her. Hank. I just... want to know where I stand.
Horses, right. Vernon something...  Hardapple.
Just kidding.
I might have his number on campus.
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
I'm working on it.
The birthday party.
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
Don't talk like that.
I'm just talking, man.
Birds.
There's a million birds here.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
That was terrific.
You should hear the bird.
It's good to listen to your daddy.
Well... not in the common way.
Cop.
Then you won't mind if I look around.
Got something to hide?
What?
No.
I was asleep.
The new man. I'd keep away from him, if I were you.
No.
How come?
It sounds like you were banished.
No thank you.
The job's okay.
Why do you think you're here?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
I suppose it's however society defines it.
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
Fuck you, Rosen!
I don't know!
In your mind, Walter. Take your time.
Where are you?
We're little kids.
I'm only asking questions.
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
I meant later... when you two took naps.
Time.
Neither do you.
What?
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
I thought I'd stay the night.
Well, Walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck.
The worst?
Yeah.
Twelve years in prison?
Bullshit.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
Not ever.
Us seeing each other.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
Well, you know Lindsey, too damn aggressive-- Son of a--!!
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
Missile compartment.  Those are the launch tubes.
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
Yup, a Benthic Petroleum paid for it.  So as long as they're hold the pink slip, I go where they tell me.
I'm switching off now.
What happened?
I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
Fine.  Be that way.
Whose then?  Lindsey?  Talk to me...
I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
Chill out, Lindsey!!
Look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  He's exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  And he's got a nuclear weapon.  So, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
Now what?
I don't know, look around.
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
God, I hate that bitch.
Why bring it here?
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
Wilhite, anything?
Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
1840... 50... 60... 70...
He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
What could be more restful than this?...  Excuse me, what is it that you want to try?
Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
You'll get over it soon. It's the usual anxiety.
But how could you say such a thing?
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
At the ruins. They're very ancient, you know.
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
Maybe you'd better ask him.
No.
Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
Once they gave me a job to draw up an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me only a day and a half to finish it, and I got paid six million lire. Ever since then I've been doing estimates for other people's designs.
As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
Aren't you going to change?
I'm too sleepy.
To do what?
To the shark.
We, too, you know. It was disastrous. First at Panarea, where there weren't any boats... then at Lipari, where everybody was asleep... And the phone call to Rome...
We'll try again.
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
I ... I ... wasn't feeling well ... I.. I was sleeping... I don't know anything ... I ... I'm all mixed up and ...
They told me that you were a very nice girl, that you always mind your business... In other words, things of that sort.
Ah, no... For me, love comes first. I'm a man, and I know what's what: first love, and then music.
From Panarea. Why?
I'll go and get my valise.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...
No, I'm not. Why do you think she does all this? It's one of the many ways she can put herself on display. When you bait the trap, the mouse will snap. To tell you the truth,  if it wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month's salary, well... But you had something you wanted to ask me?
Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
He talked to you Himself?
Who?
I can't say.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
Why?
Who tells you these things?
No I don't... the host is enough.
I don't know.
It's not my time of month.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Oh, yes!
He's told you?
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
Where do you meet?
Did it hurt?
And what happened?
I got sicker.
What baby?
From their heads...
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Martha Louise Livingston.
One.
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
You have trouble sleeping?
I don't know.
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
What the child?
Answer me!  You never answer me.
Sometimes, yes.
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
No...
She can.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
Yes?
Yes.
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
Who am I?
Of what?
I hate them.
A crucifix.
Him.
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Of course you do. Who was it?
I hate him.
I don't remember.
What?
Look into the convent records.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Larry there's got to be something missing.
What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
Next week.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me.
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
The science of psychiatry.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
It's possible isn't it?
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
She has it now.
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
I am...
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
Your niece!
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
Fine thanks...
Long, thin and filtered.
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
You're saying God did it?
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Who?  That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Is it because she's a nun?
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
What happened to the baby?
The usual ten per cent?
Eh?
Just you?
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Sixpence.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Oh, yes, now I'm with you. [he changes his accent] But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
But your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.
Yeah, she was fickle.
No, straight up.
No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Something like that.
Gear?
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
They ought to be.
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Eh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
A book!
You're only right.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
Hello.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
But I'm clean.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
That's all right then.
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
He's got you worried, then?
So's mine.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
Come on, Shake, we'll leave 'em to their penmanship.
We were going to do it.
Oh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting for you in the studio.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
I would have said so.
Aye, but you know him well.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
Don't exaggerate.
Aye, I suppose so.
But John hasn't got any.
Shurrup, cheerful.
And they want me?
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
Hell, no!  We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock!  It might be dangerous!  What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.
Gravity?
What's up?
Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
Hold it, I can't hear a damn thing!
Right.  Talk to you.
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
What do you mean?
It grows on you.
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
We have to avoid injuring it.  What we really need is some electric animal prods.
Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
Right.
I kind of like it.
No, we can't afford to lose that much oxygen.  We're going to have to flush it out.
How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
What do you mean?
He's running a fever.
Still unconscious?
Sounds like a rough one.
We can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space.
But they don't know about the translation!  They could be in danger right now.
How many?
I think it's fizzled out.
It's not going to work.
Sorry.  Nothing but that same damn transmission, every 32 seconds.  I've tried every frequency on the spectrum.
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
Let's let the machine work on him.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
Turn on navigation lights.
Engine room, what happened?
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Anything else?
I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
Quit complaining; we're in space.
But if we <u>haven't</u> caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway.
Now what?
What do you think?  Now we go in.
... More spores coming.
Can we get to him?
Yeah...
Oh man...
Okay, give me the numbers.
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
Get her on-line.  Now!
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
I'm picking up another signal.
Okay.
Uh-huh.
Sounds great.
Just give them the facts.  They can leap to their own conclusions.
You've checked that end?
Is that a fact.
Four.
Only six?
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
What time's sundown?
Phoebe.
I call myself Phoebe.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
Yes. I do.
You take charge.
D-day.
Stars.
Almost four.
Why not?
We're?
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
What of it?
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
That's not true!
Why not?
Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
And too many of them are produced.
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
Naturally enough, your understudy.
I take it she read well.
Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
I told her. I sounded off.
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Call me when you get in...
Sing it?
Many happy returns of the day...
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
So she seems.
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
Nothing, really...
What's all over?
You wouldn't understand.  How was Miss Caswell?
Gone.
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
It's time you found out. I love you.  I love you. You're a beautiful and intelligent woman-  - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress-  - at the peak of her career. You have every reason for happiness-  - every reason, but due to some strange, uncontrollable, unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid-  - kid like Eve to turn you into a hysterical, screaming harpy! Now once and for all, stop it!
Well, I am.
Don't be condescending.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
You know why I forgive Eve? Because she's left good behind - the four of us, together like this, it's Eve's fault - I forgive her...
A married lady.
Just wondered what?
Is that what you want me to be?
When I told you what every young actress should know.
But she just got here...
Oh, brother.
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
Oh-oh.
No.
Night an' day.
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
I'd like that.
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
Please...
They certainly don't waste much time.
I don't intend to be.
Why shouldn't you?  Please sit down.
I'm not crying.
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
Not at all...
Performance number one thousand of this one - if I play it that long - will take place in a well-padded booby hatch...
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
I detest cheap sentiment.
He's in love with you.
Margo, again...
Eve?
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Now just a minute-
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
Not much.
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
I'm a human being, I've got some!
Old wives' tales, born of envy and jealousy! And a phobia against truth!
The play? All right, I guess...
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Don't be evasive.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
To you, too?
I mean really, deeply angry...
I don't think I could be.
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
What's your being married got to do with it?
That's right, but I don't understand-
Play it again.
I ain't gonna die. Not with a hit.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
Well...
Answer my question!
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
Let me lay a little theory on you--
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
--see?--
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
'68.
Nixon.
And I'll just shitkick in my usual way.
--I haven't said anything--
How high up, which Republicans?
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
Hmm?
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
--to become President Nixon's campaign manager on March 1, Mitchell personally approved withdrawals from the fund--
Oh.
Whatever.
The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
--Howard Hunt?
--Teddy Kennedy?
I didn't do anything wrong.
Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
--"I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto." That was your spiel then. "The Lifestyles of Deserters."  I'm still waiting for it.
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
Give me your checkbook then.
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
FBI too?
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
What do you want to know?
Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
My non-denial denial.
So?
--melodramatic?  Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
I couldn't say.
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
Lotsa hints--
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
Could develop.
I know, I did, but damnit Howard--  For the first time since I've known him, I think he's really humping...
--Harry, weren't you just arguing the opposite way?--
He just did.
I won't talk about the other two.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.  When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
Pardon me?
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Of course, I didn't --
Do I have to?
What's your middle name?
So you're going to Michigan?
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
Then don't.
What?  We both have cars.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
I think I've had one.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
Do you?
I don't get it, that really works?
Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
Pontificated.
Just in time.
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Okay, well that about covers it.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
After high school.
You've got something going?
God dammit, Stifler!
You think so?
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Does it tell me how to get laid?
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
Dude, prom sucks.
<u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Doing what?
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
Just like sex with my wife.
Would you shut up?
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
No it isn't! You're dead!
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
It's okay. I can see fine.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
I don't... I... I can't remember...
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
Yeah. French fries...
No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal?  Shake a paw?
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Looks like he lied to you too.
My men think you died and floated away in the Seine. If I wanted to, I could let them believe that.  But that would be illegal...
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
I told you. These murders are not normal.
Allo?
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
You fucking liar!
Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
Come out! I can do alterations.
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
I was all out of dynamite!
It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
I'm glad you	did too.
Anya... where are we?
I'll never let go!
I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
Shut up!
Are you feeling all right?
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
She does.
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
Alvy Singer over here!
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
Well, you only give me books with the word "death" in the title.
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
Yes.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
That movie makes me feel guilty.
M'm.
Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Well, no... not just, not only.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
Oh, you do?
Oh.
Sure, I got... I got nothing, uh, nothing till my analyst's appointment.
Fifteen years?
Oh, sorry.
Neat, yeah.
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
what I mean?
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
it's my first time.
Oh.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah?
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
Yeah.
Mine.
It relaxes me.
Oh, come, you don't need that.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
It was just great!
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
Very big spider.
snow shovel or anything or something.
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
Yeah.
Oh, darn it.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
This is the first book that I got you.
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?
Can I confess something?
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
Step up here!
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
Don't get upset!
Dammit! I was so close.
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
What-
Oh, you got a headache!
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
You'll total the whole car.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Oh, Jesus.
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
SO?
Oh, yes, yes.
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
We're going to take them to the airport.
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
Oh.
And here, you just-
A long time.
Oh yes.
I hate the sight of blood.  You guys don't take prisoners.
Absolutely.
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
October-ish.
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
It's alright, isn't it?
It's always not this time.  If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone.
I don't know how to make her funny.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Just don't fucking tell her.
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
Damn straight.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
When does he graduate high school?
Harry called.
Lucy overdosed.
Leave us alone right now.
Monica.
You have?
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Oh yeah?
I don't think so.
Anytime, sport.
Fantastic.  Out here.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
We've only been over this how many times?
Through the sweats or not?
I missed all of you.  We're okay, aren't we?
She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold.
No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
You want me to uninvite her?
Skye!  I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
It's taken care of.
Otis!!!!
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
About me!
Don't do this.
I wanted you back.
Yes.
You don't have to.
He's my favorite.
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
Oh.  Well.  Good.
It's a novel.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Ah.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
Sally did all this herself?
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
Trust him.
I don't need a drug.
No, never.
That was my clue.
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
Will champagne help?
You don't know she's a bitch.
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Like the last time.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
Well, something's wrong.
Um.  Happy for you.
You're my best friend.
You don't need to thank me.
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
Well, so glad you decided to come.
Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us?
And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over.  Because you're both, so, what - introspective?  And you should have done it ages ago.  I'm Sophia Gold.  Come meet my husband, Cal.
Ah.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
Why are you doing this?
Thank goodness.  Breaktime.
Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
I'm Princess Bala.
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
I <u>didn't</u> choose him.  What kind  of <u>idiot</u> would...  ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
Well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  You go back.  Me, I'm going to Insectopia.
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
Wait, I hear something!
Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
Stop fooling around in there.
Yes?
Forget it.  You go ahead, I give up. I...I don't know what I was thinking. "Insectopia".
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
In love?  I'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  I'll tell you what I love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
Yes, General Formica.  Carry on, my good man!  I don't know what we would do without you.
Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
That's sweet.  That's real sweet.
Yeah.  How much?
Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her, and she's out of a job.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal...  Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
So what are you waiting for -- a singing commercial?
That's me. 
I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
Sure.
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
Eight-thirty.
How come?
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
What's her first name?
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
No doubt about it.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Sure.
Gin.
In this house, you're supposed to.
Oh.
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
I know so. He's a taker.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Fine. How's your eye?
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
No, thank you.  I -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- I have this heavy date for tonight --
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
In there.
Seven --  -- queen.
Last night?
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
Yes, sir.
What kind of joint are you running?
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
Swap them? For what?
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
Well -- I guess so.
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
Sir?
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Mine?
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
Yes, sir.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
I see.
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
I dig.
Thank you, sir.
Now hold on, Baxter --
Yes?
Oh, yes.  She's the best operator in the building.
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
Listen to him.  Little Lord Fauntleroy!
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because you took too many sleeping pills. Do you understand what I'm saying?  Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss -- I'm here to help you. You took all those sleeping pills -- remember?
Well -- we work in the same building -- and we try to keep it quiet --
Kubelik -- with two k's.
What's her address?  Where does she live?
It's regulations.
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
That so.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
You got a girl-friend?
My shoes.
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
You're not being funny.
Okay. I'm sorry.
Handle what?
Are you sure that's what you want?
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
The nerve.
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
Certainly not.  I'm a happily married man.
Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Maybe we should send up two flies -- and see if they'll propagate in orbit.
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
Now just a second -- I'm doing you a favor, buddy -- what're you trying to pull?
Moonby. Got any Winstons?
What is this?
Which part is that ?
Rangers, eh?
Tracks ?
Sometimes.
How long were you up there ?
A long time.
I don't know.
... he's an amazing officer.
Mangoes? There as a fucking tiger in the woods -- I could've been eaten alive. I'm never going into that jungle again. I gotta remember never get out of the boat; never get outta the boat.
Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
In the middle of the jungle -- a goddamn light.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Yeah, it still runs.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
What about an American named Kurtz?
You can cut out the sir, Lance -- I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy foot.
That's terrible -- we'll change that -- I'd like to see you work -- I've always liked your cutback; got a hell of a left turn, too.
Sure -- fine --
Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
Music?
No -- no, sir.
What do you mean, Colonel?
No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
Going back  - to the jungle to die.
I'm taking you back. You can still live.
Yes, I know...
Men looked up to him...  He died as he lived...
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
You think he'd of shot us?
A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here.
He's a man who knows what he wants -- he does know what he wants.
No shit... I think I shot the hell out of him.
I wasn't looking.. I was running.
I'm sorry to hear that.
What's a big question?
Gaston would never tell me. It was asubject not to be spoken of, Captain.
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
This -- Bob Hope or the like --
Needs patching.
94   CONTINUED:  
How?  Nobody this far north monitors that frequency until avalanche season.  Besides, I'm surprised a tough guy like you uses fancy electronics.
I was gone, in September, laying traplines.  She went to our cache for some meat.  Got mauled by a bear.  Tore open her skull. -more-
-- Corbett's a killer.
The radio's on the fritz.
Really.  I thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.  By the way -- your truck also 'on the fritz?'
Why?
Be right back.  I left my camcorder in the car.
Was there any trouble?
Can't help myself.  Corbett's type always pisses me off.  Oh, I found this at the post office.  Had your name on it.
That's not what I meant.
Not me.  I'm equipped.
So what's the problem?
I got your plate number, asshole. Maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail.
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
Hunting and trapping was a damn fine life.  Me and Mitchell, Bob and LeMalle, we were teams.  I'd always go with Mitchell.  Good man, Mitchell.  I'd let Bob worry about goddamn LeMalle.  We'd hire a plane in October.  On the way to a dirt airstrip somewhere, we'd drop supplies.  We'd land, tell the pilot to come back for us a few days before Christmas.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
Hate to disappoint you.
Told that's what our old man was. Planned on going to sea, me and Bob, 'til I read Jack London. Started trapping when I was ten. Mailed the furs to Sears.  Eight bucks for a skunk, three for a muskrat.  That was fine money.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
You broke the radio, remember?
The time has passed for men like them and me.  I know it.  But they're still fighting for survival, like cornered animals. That's why they'll kill you. -more-
Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
No, I better stay at my post.
But I would.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
Sure.
This isn't your concern.  It's over, here and now.
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
Welcome.
No.
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
Go ahead.
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
Okay.
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
What the heck do you mean?
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
I'm not saying nothing to you.
Okay by me.
It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Well, that's a load off.
Melvin...
Did you like it that much?
Picking on me won't help.
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
What?
What?  You think I'm running you up?
Just do your job.
Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
Bullshit.
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
Why don't you tell me.
The contract was stolen.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
He stole another contract.
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
We don't have a choice.
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
Because I'm done.
How did you get into the business?
You were like a boy genius?
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
No.  Just the first one.
I don't.
Yes.
Not even a stalemate?
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
Fine.
What?  What if he brings it with him?
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
What did he want?
What did he say?
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
I think I got one today.
So?
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
Nobody ever sees me.
Why in the hell would you take that chance?
No?
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up.  And I watched them make love through the keyhole.
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
Is this becoming complicated?
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
I'm not normal.
Right.  In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
Do you think about their wives or their families?
I don't know.  Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't trust her.
Taken.
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Why didn't you fade?
No.
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
What's that? Free!
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
Still, fifty cents ain't bad.
Like Custer huh?
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
So?
You sure got a handle on that word "we".
Yeah, you're in luck there's two of them, the other's in there.
I thought that was part of the charm!
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
I've been saying that since we met.
Can you do the lock on it?
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
You should have said it was Bring-A-Bottle.
Why don't we go together?
You're all bloody useless.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
You capitalist pig!
They ain't the only ones.
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
No!
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
Really?
Well not any more, now I'm a serious writer and above this crap.
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
So, we won't be going to London?
No, not just yet.
No way Doug, I can't.
Yeah, you're right.... I've got an idea!
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
But we could go to London and live in England.
I'm sorry about what I said, really I am. Just take me with you, I don't care where.
Can we charge admission?
Yo, dobree!
That's only the half of it. I've heard a rumour they're taking over a theatre to use for alternative arts; you know what that means?
Insurance!
Yeah seems okay.
Sometimes.
Run into Josh?
Alright!
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
Really!
Not all of them!
Yeah!
Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
No problem, is it at your place?
Yes, if you can get him free.
Alright, I'll see to it and things'll be just as they were, okay?
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
The storage facility will be ready within a week, I'll call you then.
I don't care about Americans. Arrest them all if you have to, but keep those records secret.
I do.
He wants to show now.
Late night.  You?
That'd be something.
I don't make small talk --
-- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
This play -- ?
So you agree you need help?
And you have to meet my father.
Could be...
That is my telescope.
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
In 76 years, me neither.
Yes. And?
Thank you. So were you.
I don't want to be just your friend --
What?
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
You planned this --
What about your father?
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
He wants help with his lines --
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
I'm no dummy.
I'd do that --
For pay?
Where did you get -- ?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
I didn't say you did.
Scalene?
I beg your pardon?
I was practicing. I've got an audition next week -- I gotta practice. How am I gonna get famous if I don't practice?
Mom, how else are we gonna see the sunrise?
Uh, thanks...
Uh, hi....
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
George, if you don't want Chinese food, pick a place you want to go and make a reservation.
Okay, then!
Huh?
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
I'm going to be at the dance.
And where am I gonna be?
George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
Five cents, please.
Pro, the sun's out!
Then where the hell is he?
Uh, Marty Lewis! I almost didn't recognize him -- haven't seen him in years.
No! Don't tell me!  I don't want to know the future! My knowledge of future events... your mere presence here... could have devastating effects on the course of history. And altering history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear. My immediate response is to send you back to your own time.
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
What? 
I run this place! 
Yeah... Jesus! I wonder how he ever got up enough nerve to marry my mom.
What do you feed him?
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
I used to throw trash for the City.
Tom...
Yeah.
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
Cause I can't allow it.
What's your friend's name?
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
I know.
Yeah.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
I got him in the stomach.
Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
I don't blame him.
Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
This your place?
Yes.
Stay as long as you like.
Git.
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
Planet 10?
First thing I did.
The deuce you say.  That crate!
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
So I was right.  That's nice to know...
Not really.  This is pretty important.
What? How do you know that?
This is so embarrassing...
She was killed, Penny.
Oh, my.
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.
You don't wanna know.
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
Before Bill came to Hollywood.
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
Nothing, really. Said he was in the insurance business.
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Who?
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
Well, you just... sound a little–
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York – hopefully our numbers are growing – who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths – not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
I can feel my butt getting sore already.
And I could tell you some stories –
Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really gotten started yet – what happened to your ear?
Yeah...
Hi, Charlie.
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie. I'll miss you.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
Why don't we go to your room-
Don't worry about it, Barton. We can sort it-
What do you think happened?
You're in pictures, Barton. Even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.
I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was – well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
Only fry you once.
Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul – well, all right, a little bit, for the critics – but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".
All night?
Were you drinking?
When did you start drinking again?
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
What else is new?
She said what you said she'd say.
I thought you quit.
I slept with her once in school.  I was just a kid.  I was experimenting.  It was just that one time.  She developed a... fixation... on me.  She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did.  It scared me.
You saw all the reports, Beth!
Did you go home with him?
Only when they make interesting reading.
Yes, you do.
That's right.
Thanks.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
She wiped out her whole family.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
Why not?
A boy kills his parents.  They have a plane.  He makes it look like an accident.
It hurts.
Why?
I found Lisa Henderson.
Did you?  What's she doing?
Come over here and tell me no.
I'm writing a book.
Somebody always does.
How did it end?
Yes I am.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
Nilsen?
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
Thanks.
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
I came in here to jack off the damn machine.  One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein.  Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what?  He was her counselor.
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car?  I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
She said alone -- suite 405.  It ain't gonna take long.
Sometimes I think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with Internal Affairs.
No.
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
Fourteen.  We seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  That's why you didn't find it in your computer.
Yes I did.
Rene's been telling me about your work.
Not sure. How was yours?
No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
Let's get out of here.
Of what?
No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every day. That I got sick of.
What's wrong?
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
No.
You haven't been by lately.
How do you know?
Just look at him.  Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so.
Sure, ok..
What are they?
What?
Not what?
We don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
Yeah... Maybe just his arms.  Put some Cerulean Blue there.
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
Hi Gina.
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
Come on, let's get out of here.
Drugs??!
Can I walk you home?
A present I picked up for you.
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
You only want one Big Mac?
I'll take it.  Andy, gimme three thousand dollars.  Just the caviar – I'll get the rest.
Would you check out my studio some time?
I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
Yes, I suppose that we did.
Wrong on both counts.
Well that's a ... long story ...
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
Had one.  Didn't work.
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
Was.
Huh?  You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
I want in.  The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all ... dirty.  Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here ...
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
Oswald:  We need one more thing.
I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
It is the hearts of two good men whom I have had the honor of calling son.  Take it, child.  But I implore you, never open it.  You look so like your mother.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Thanks.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Divide and conquer.
I'm afraid to ask.
I don't know.  It just feels right.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
He'll be here.
I'll borrow it from you.  Four million - -
I can make it.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
Umm-hmmmm.
No.  Her case is too advanced.  But maybe, someday, with more research-
Just the beast.
From the other side of the equator-
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions.  So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment.  Got me?
We've been going out over a year now and...Okay, here goes.  Bruce, I want to spend my life with you.
But there's nothing you've done under the cover of darkness I couldn't learn to understand.
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
Dick, don't push me right now.
She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
One kiss and you could lift the mask from his lifeless face.  Their secret identities would be revealed.  But how best to bait a brid?
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
I've got to stop him.
Then you never loved me?
Hardly a worry, sir.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
Apology hastily retracted.
Take any three you like. After you get settled we can...
Not the Jaguar. The _other_ car.
Why, indeed?
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
Dick has run away. They have taken Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they found the cave, sir. It's been destroyed.
And another name for Mystery?
What is it about the wrong kind of man? In grade school it was guys with earrings. College, motorcycles and leather jackets.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
The press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way...  And what light through yonder window breaks? `Tis the east. And you are...
Just ones this beautiful.
The letter writer is obsessed with you. His only escape may be...
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
What are you talking about?
Chase. There's something I need to tell you--
And when you finally get Two-Face?
You're right, Edward. I didn't mean to be impolite. Please.
Paranoid? The psychotic?
...The Box can change their lives.  Our stock coupons will spike.
I don't think so.
Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
You sunk my battleship.
Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
Shouldn't we --
No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  Untraceable. It's very elegant.
No.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
... Looks like a convention.
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
What if I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one?
I've had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all you expert sources.
Take 'em! I want his head!
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
Don't let your job interfere with your business.  -- Someone's been talking to Harvey Dent.
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
That's it.
Huh. Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up.
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...
Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
Of course not.  I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement.  A loss I trust Bernie will be able to reverse.
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
And a car.
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
Sure did.
I vote for Bart.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
What?
Yeah, heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this thing back to the house.
Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Me first!
Forget it, bunghole!
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
Turd-burglar...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Oh, that's nice.
Sorry to hear that. Me, I took a beating.
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
Well, sir it's not good.  Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
Jesus jumped-up... Bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference.  Well, it's not gonna happen!
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
Uh, do you think these two sluts still live in Highland? That would be cool.
Does that mean you'd consider it in two weeks?  You don't have to answer now.  He wants me to check the deed restriction anyway.  You take your vacation, Adam.  Say 'bye!
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
This is going to take some time.
I can't clean anything.  The vacuum is out in the garage.  I can't leave the house.  Why don't they tell us something?  Where are all the other dead people in the world?  Why is it just you and me?
We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
Death didn't improve your sense of humor.
How long do you suppose we were waiting?
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts. Do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  Moan louder!
You know you're really a pretty girl.
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.
Bet... el... geuse.  What an awful name.  I thought it was like -- you know.  The <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.
Maybe we should knock first?
Who did the sushi?
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Give or take a year.
We're ghosts.
And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
You're the dead.
Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
I... I don't know what your name is.
Yes.
It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
Good thing you are beautiful, kid. You are <u>dumb</u>!
That's it!
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
Then <u>I'll</u> help them.  For a price.
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
Delia hates it.
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
They're ghosts.  They do what they want.
No, no, c'mon, Max, you know me. I've got plans.  You gotta come up here and see, then I'll tell you about it.
Otho, can you do it?
Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
I saw some ghosts.
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  We must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
Look at the tiny figures.
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
Yes, Robert. But it's not bad.
Hardly any, Robert.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
Oh, really?
Yes. I love Eve very much.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Oh. I have a message for him.
Yes. I am.
Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you...  David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
Fine. He's very nice.
I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
Yes, so do we.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
To watch...? To watch me...?
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Yes. It's a very good show.
I see.
Yes, Eve. I shall yield too.
I certainly do.
Oh, good.
And yours, sir - Chauncey Gardiner!  How poetic! Chauncey, a name of uncertain meaning! And Gardiner, a bit of the French, a suggestion of a stroll through the flowers! A beautiful name, my friend!
... I see.
Yes. You look very sick.
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.
No, Ben.
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
Yes.
No.
I agree.
Of course. I would like to look.
I see.
Yes. It seems to be.
I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
Yes.
Yes. That is surprising.
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
... How long have you been living here?
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
Yes, I will.
Sure, try again - where? There's nothing, it's like he never existed!
Do you need a secretary?
Yes, ma'am.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
No! He's a real gardener!
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
Gardiner, yes, sir.
No problem, Chief.
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
Good. Anything else?
Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.
I never played a jewel thief.
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
I'm a puppeteer.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
Hmmm.
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
Hmmm.
Right.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
I'm scared.
We'll talk about it in the car.
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
What?
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
I need a shower.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Schwartz.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
Forget it.
Yes?
You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
No, really.
I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
My tits?
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you.
You can be John Malkovich.
Yes. Yes. A thousand times, yes!
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
Gehginnis ondah foam?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
Did you see the reviews?
Yes, Maxine, yes.
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
Know it, and go on out the yard. Go on.
Say the Word!
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
You still know.
Aw, Baby.
No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
and she is mine...
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN.
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
That's not true. I told you, I had to get you out, make you safe...so's you and me could be together on the other side, forever..
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
Yes ma'am..
Well, come on in. You letting in flies.
Yes ma'am.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
Go upstairs I said!!
Was over to Baby Suggs.
I know Denver.
You sure?
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
You planning to do anything about it?
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
Paul D.
No, You looking good.
Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Why me, man?
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
Well Dude, we just don't know.
Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.
Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS- OF- BITCHES--
Come and get it.
ANTI-SEMITE!
We have the urn.
That is for the urn.
What--
Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit.
They were Nazis, Dude?
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These men are cowards.
I've had a--
Uh-huh.
These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
I see.
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Well--sure, I could do that--
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
And please don't call her my mother.
Dieter has been on the fringes of-- well, of everything in L.A., for about twenty years.  Look at my LP's. Under 'Autobahn.'
I want you to see him immediately.
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place. Wanted to save the finder's fee.
No, but--
Am I wrong!
Huh?
Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
MARK IT ZERO!
Am I wrong!
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
But Walter--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
What about the toe?
Dude--
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Near the In-and-Out Burger--
The bulk of the series.
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, depending on the options.  Wait in the car, Donny.
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
It is a fucking emergency.
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!
What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything!  What the fuck were you talking about?!
Okay, listen--
My wife is not the issue here. I hope that my wife will someday learn to live on her allowance, which is ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that will be her problem, not mine, just as your rug is your problem, just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility regardless of whom he chooses to blame.  I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs, some chinaman in Korea took them from me but I went out and achieved anyway. I can't solve your problems, sir, only you can.
Dude.
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
Well we--I don't--
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
Well, okay, if you've already made out the check.  Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside.
Walter!
Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
Someday.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
The House of Pain.
I didn't know.
What?
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
I'm not giving you a choice, old man.
I wouldn't worry about it.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Blood...
Thought you were dead.
Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
I don't know about this, man --
Maybe it's better that way.
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
Wait.
I don't buy it.
You've been here longer than you think.
It worked, didn't it?
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
And that's a good thing?
Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
I don't know --  Look at this blood smear --
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
Perhaps.
There is one other thing. I'd buy yourself a gun if I were you. If you start becoming sensitive to the daylight, if you start becoming thirsty regardless of much you've had to drink -- then I suggest you take that gun and use it on yourself. Better that, than the alternative.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
What do you mean?
Closer.
Nick!!
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
--whatever; that's her.
You sure?
Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
You said the name "James."
Get your goddamn--
Why?
I can't.
Sometimes.
No.
Well, please keep me fucking informed!
What? That made her lose the baby?
Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
Fine.
I do.
I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
Butt-ugly owl.
Too busy eating us?
Don't have one.
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
How's she going to know where to--
--Domini!
--turn the camera off--
It's not a real "funny" time for us, okay?
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
Not planning on sleeping at all.
Smells Like Teenage Spirit.
Okay.
Still working on it.
Elly Kedward?
That's why she kills children.
She's off her fucking rocker--
Heather.
Yeah.
She's far from "fine."
--thank you for calling--
Your mother's pastor.
No.
What?! Did Ray tell you that?
Meurice--
Your husband.
On the phone. Was it for you?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
I don't know. I better get off now.
You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened...
With your gun?...
Thanks.
What?
Yeah.
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
What do you mean...
I want you to go fishing.
Got something to show me first?
So it would seem.
You said the usual--
Red Label.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
Tuesday is ladies' night.
Yeah. How's Dad?
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Okay.
The criminals are winning.
Okay. come on in. Looks like you had a bad face lift.
Only you. and the photo lab.
Hello, daddy.
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
Those are my breasts.
Can I feel 'em?
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  . Hey, pretty, pretty.
Jeffrey.
Yes.
Then don't talk about killing.
. same here.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
Frank would open you.
Sometimes I think I do.
You. what?
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
No. not really.  but also because I really want you to be alright.
Oh God, Jeffrey. is that you? Oh God.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
Go where?
What?
Yes.
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
Maybe so.
Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
I don't know.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Let's go.
Yes. I do.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
Goodnight.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
No.
It's good to see you.
Where to?
... You look beautiful.
I like that idea. that's a real good idea.
Just a minute.
Frank!!
Are you feeling okay?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
No. No thank you.
Yeah. okay.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.
This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One and I'm out.  Give me a good price for old time's sake.  What do you think?
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they? I wanted to shoot myself.
Two years.  George, I can't wait that long.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
Excuse me?
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
For calling you a homo.
I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's going to blow an O-ring.
No fucking way.
What's the other one?
I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
Good night.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
Oh my G-d.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
How many kilos can we fit in these planes?
George, are we gonna do this or not?
Coke.
In how long?  A week?
You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend. Welcome to my country.
Yes.
Yes, it is.
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
I know.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
I'll tell her.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
Alright.
Out.
What?
Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say something like that.  Always thinking about yourself.
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Yeah.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
What?
Yeah.
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
You swear?
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
Yes, I do.
Yes, I am.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
It's true.
I'll explain.
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
Because we aren't ready yet for the French. Before attacking, we must have safe places from which to depart and find refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There are too many drunks, pushers, whores, addicts, spies ... people who talk too much ... people who are ready to sell themselves, undecided people. We must either convince them or eliminate them. We must think of ourselves first. We must clean out the Casbah first. Only then will we be able to deal with the French. Do you understand, Ali?
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
Sure ...
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Good evening, sir.
For many months, I've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... And naturally, I am under the illusion that I know you somewhat. You never seemed the type, Kader, inclined to performing useless actions.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Why?
You got something on the Coke?
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
What'd he die of?
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
I didn't hear it.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I had some papers to pick up.
Yes.
What kind of condition are you referring to?
Why do you think she left you?
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
Yes -- several times.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
No.
Chinese peony root.
Then -- those are not your own words?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
We dated for about a month last year.
Then what happened?
What changed?
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
Three fifteen.
Sorry.
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
I'll have you out in a few hours.
How?
Try.
No -- it just doesn't look right.
That's not an answer.
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
You and me -- making love.
I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
You can see me now.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.
I'm supposed to be on vacation.
Well, I guess that makes you the best.  Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars.  As executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us.  All I'm asking you to do is talk to her.
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on to another line of questioning.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
We have to talk.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
That's too bad.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
What time did you leave?
I said NO!
No. You can have them.
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it.  You think she had sex with him?
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
Nobody did.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
Yeah.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
What's he like?
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
Then what happened?
We got engaged.
Why did you stop?
Do you miss it?
No. I'll do them later.
What?
Are you all right?
We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
No. I was just... No.
I'll pick you up.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
How about Bari?
Nobody's asking you to.
I sat outside and had coffee.
Near the church.
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
I bet you could do a book.
No. I couldn't.
Because I already tried once.
No, I don't mind.
What?
No.
Yes, thanks.
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
Yeah. It could get better.
Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
Where you going?
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
I don't remember!
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
So what the hell's the good news?
What the hell you talking about?
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there.  Just be glad I did and you can start life from here instead of down there.
I do alright.  Everybody's happy.
It ain't the money - it's the high.  The big fat floating 'what if?'  And it's way more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So you never have to pay out.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
You mean as opposed to your life?
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
And you believe her?
I'm sure I can make your mother like me. But then do I gotta worry 'bout your father?
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Maybe I oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out. You'll feel better, I promise.
You haven't?
Should I?
Ours!
Evidence of what?
Here, put this in his mouth.
Know what?
What are you talking about?
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
Gimme the gun.
What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires.  Did you know he did time himself?
They just left, didn't they?
Violet, I won't let you leave.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.
Shut up, Violet!  This is between me and Johnnie.
What?
What happened to them?
I don't know.  We may never know, but I'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the Karpoli family.
Don't tell him --
Shut up, Violet!
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Don't try to tell me what to do.
You betrayed me!
They were in a car accident.
But everybody is all right.
I'm listening.
It's all right, sir.
Where's the fucking money?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Me?  Why?
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
Oh yeah.  Violet!
Yeah.
'63 Chevy.
I knew it.
Thanks.
My pleasure.
What do you want?
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
You mean Shelly?
Yes.
That's what he told himself.  But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are.  I understand them.
You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
You think I'm lying?
In his office.  I saw it this morning.
Like each other?  They hate each other.
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
That's his brother.
Sweet Jesus.
Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
Any bodyguards?
Fine.
If he does ...
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
Why?
Because of what you are going to tell him.  You have to make it as real as you can.  The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
No.
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
I think everything is okay.
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
Turn?  To who?  Where does he turn? What does he have to offer?  He's got nothing.  He's a killer.  He's a piece of equipment for crissake. Where's he gonna turn?
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
I don't know.
So now you know.
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
-- sir? --
Yes, I'm here...
...I understand...
Who?  Who came?
His brother.  You know his brother?
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
I think not...  No, I'm sorry.  It was very sudden. He was here very briefly.
We thought you were gone for good.
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
What if I say no?
What does that mean?
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
What are you talking about?
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
Where are we?
That's it?  Is that it?
Thanks for the ride.
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
-- let me do this, okay? --
I didn't know this would happen.
Oh, Jesus...
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
What is that?
xxxxxx
I can't protect you anymore.
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
He run away often?
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
What?
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
-- I want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
All of them?
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
I told you.  You need to rest.
I don't remember Zurich.
...elephoned sir.
...ampered. with it, Spoor.
...aven't you?
What? You mean you've got ...
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
What? ...Jill? Jill who? Jill who?
David ... in a free society information is the name of the game. You can't win the game if you're a man short.
Beginner's luck.
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
Well, since you disappeared up the ladder of Information Retrieval ... I don't expect to see you slumming in Records - what's the problem?
How do you mean?
Not much.
Not really, no.
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
You got the wrong man.
I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
Look after that suit, eh. Barbara chose it for me.
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Out of kindness.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
Well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
How do you think I feel? You shit!
Jack ...
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
If you say so.
No.
Them?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
We? Don't blame me!
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
Are you still following me?
Please, Jill ... I love you.
You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
Don't do anything silly.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
Tuttle?
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Yes.
I know that.
A woman eh? I see.
What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
Well, she's my mother, not yours.
I won't be held responsible.
By the way, I saw a wonderful idea for Christmas presents at the chemists. Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
What have you done with his body?
I ... uh ...
Er, yes ...
Numero deux, duck a l'orange. 
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
Hello. Mr Lowry?
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Have you got one or haven't you?
It's a 27B/6 of course.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
No. Wait here.
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
I'm sorry, Pierce.  You're going out with Marcus. Duty calls. The City needs you.
In that time, you ever have sex?
No underwear?
Red Death?  Tell me something, Frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? The kids selling that shit have no sense. They'll be taken care of, don't worry about that.
He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
Well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
At least he's got people around him.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
Yes.
Yes.
I think this place stinks.
I'll be right down.
Okay.
He's better, though, right?
He's better.
Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
I need to sit down a minute.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
The ghosts--
He's dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll try to bring him back.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
She's no whore, Marcus.
She wasn't looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
What's that, Frank?
The brakes are shot.
Well, he's the steakhead of the night, then.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
Let me think.
He's crazy. He can't help it.
Well, why don't they put him away? Prisons don't want him. I took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
Do it!
What?
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
I'm not hungry.
Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
You really think so?
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
What?
Just don't physically...  Fantastic tip -- fantastic.
It's not loaded.
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
As good as humanly possible.
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.
Aaron, will you tell me?
People phoned in.
Let me think a second.  It's tough.
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
No.  You know that I'm not.
Speaking.
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
I'll put him in the low corner of the frame -- good.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Thanks.
It depends on how big a news day it is.
Uh-uh.  I'm a little freaked right now about seeing my father though.
I liked it.  He's not afraid to be human.
I spent a fortune on this.
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
He said something about...
Yes.  That's right.
No...no.
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this.  Sorry. Go ahead.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
I'll just have to try harder.  I don't know.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.
It's not opinion.
Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.
I like "godsend."
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
I trust you.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
Me!
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
It's not that it's hard.  I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
Good night??!
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
I knew what you meant.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
N-no...
Anything new?
He made a cat.
Walter!  Jeez!
Are you ready?
Just about anything, Walter.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
I admit it.
Why don't you cover it up, Walter!
I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
Now what kind of statue was that?
Yeah what's this, Murdered Elephant?
I didn't mean to.
Alright get a grip on yourself Now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
Have a seat -
You might talk too much.
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
Well, w-what did you do?
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
Smack?
Turn around!
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
Well I'm overjoyed.
I worked in one of them.  Back in Alaska. 
Really?
I can't.  I gotta go home.
Gee.  Thanks.
I was just straightening up the place.
Uh, I can take real good care of myself, Mrs. Swicker!
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
Wrong answer!  No prize.
We're looking at a dog, possible coffee...
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
Something like that.
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
Buffy.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
Why'd you come back?
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
He did what he was supposed to.
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
I'm glad you came.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
Yeah, whoops I came.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
What are you talking about?
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
None of your business.  God.
All right.
It's true.
Yes.  They travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  The vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  You were difficult to trace, and I think the process has gone a lot further than I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  But for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
Sporting events, yeah.
Oh.  Good.
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Not if you're careful.
I wish you would.
It isn't important.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
All right.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
So very much.
Okay, let's go.
But --
Hey, wait a minute...
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
Like you've got a grip.
Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
I don't think so.
You said "Crash".
Catch?
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
It's all the same thing.
Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
I'll tuck you in.
You can't seduce me.
I know what it is.
So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
--but you're father's in there!
I won't be needing these anymore.
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
Let me.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
Don't you think I'm pretty?
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
I heard already.
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
Not yet.  It takes years of practice...
What?
You need a nickname.
That's what I been telling everybody!  Wanta dance?
Oh both of you, of course...
Well, I held it like an egg.
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
How?
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
Then go.
Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
My right.
Forget it.
I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
Yeah, thanks for everything.
Don't try me.
C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
See ya at the yard, Meat.
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Who ain't?
Well, I'd rather not say.
What?
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
He's lying.
You were wandering around.
Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino. I guarantee it.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.
Excuse me.
The worst was Blue.
Yeah.
He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
Hello.
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?  Yeah, right, I'm sure.
...and he tells me to go fuck myself.
Bullshit or no bullshit, they put you in that book, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. You will not be able to walk into the casino. I'm tellin' you.
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
No, I don't wanna come -
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
What people?
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
How'd you know I was here?
Well...
I'll be right there.
No, that's quite all right.
You bet.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
All right, we're clear.
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
...and she doesn't always -
Nice to see you, Senator.
Ginger's mission in life was money.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
What do you need?
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
...under?
It's under...
All right...
With what?
First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.
Yeah.
I put her to bed.
I was with somebody.
What if he won't stop?
I mean, it could get us both killed.
I can back him off.
Oh, sh-
Listen to me.
You understand? What? Let you go?
I want you to let me go.
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
Not gonna let me in?
Bullshit! Bullshit!
How many kids do you have?
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
Okay, I'll -
I really think you're -
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
This is not the way to treat people.
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't wanna leave anything to chance.
No.
No, Sir.
Can you do it with your left hand?
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
...I got muscled on the street.
Shut your mouth!
You shut up.
Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
Yes.
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
Jeff, would you go in with her?
Okay.
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!
Now move along.
Carmine's gone.
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
How are you?
E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 'Now, go!']
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
I know.
Ma che cazzo!
All right.
Okay, Sammy.
Oh, you did? I didn't know that.
I'll be there.
Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
Nothin'.
Okay.
Everything went to his head. 
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
But I saw something...
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
Yes.
You are.
He was just on the phone.
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
Listen...
...they're in Penthouse K.
I think that's it.
All right.
Two?
Why?
Of course.
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
I took care of everybody.
Hey, Shelly. 
Stacy. 
I told him I didn't know nothin'. But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
Do I hear a motion seconded?
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
In women?
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
So, did you see "Seinfeld" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh.
I'm sure.
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Winning.
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
And...your point?
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
Hello, Rachel. I'm Selina.
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
Yeah, she's okay.
I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
Okay, deal.
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
Pretty good...Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay, getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take..
What kind of name is "Brock Leviathan?"
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
Oh pooh, come now. If you turn me down, I just might throw a fit..you know how us girls can be..
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
Do I hear a woman's voice?
Taking messages.
I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
I am not!  Fuck you!  Theo's a genius.
I'm sorry.  You'll do all right without me.  Keep my share.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
You can tell she was really worried about me.
Bullshit.
That's your "rep."
If you know that just back off.
Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
We've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Will you let me explain!
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
Oh won't I?
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
What makes you say that?
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
I hear them coming upstairs.  I won't be able to talk for awhile. I have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  So don't talk.  Don't say a word or they'll hear it.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
I've got to ask somebody.
Even if you found us -- what then?
Do you know what's in that box?
They've still got to be able to sign his name.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
Don't panic.  I might be wrong.  Hello?  I guess I was wrong.
What did you do?
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
Hand me the phone.
Whose money is this?
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
The guy with the transplant.
They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
You were at the Emerald that night?
He wants 75 back.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
You're the man with the gun.
Naturally.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
My fence in San Francisco ... 305-4410.  Maurice.  Don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
Sure, like I'm gonna take advice from you.
Whatever you say.
There are no guarantees in this life.
What time frame have you got in mind?
You already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
Five minutes.
I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
Are you busting my chops or what?
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
Tell the truth, I was going to take a much needed leak.
Doesn't everybody?
Government business?
What do you think his name is?
Fuck off back to Essex!
Off his wages.
And what's it like?
Hi. You forgot your bag.
Yes...
Are you jealous of him?
Maybe.
Depends what it is.
You mean that?
I said stop it.
Will you meet me again?
I should have known, shouldn't I?
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
I'm working on it.
Sorry.
He'd bring me carnations.
Okay.
Why, honey --
I can't.
Sorry. What you doing?
Told you to stay in the hotel!
I was trying to get out of something.
Jimmy?
You knew my Jody?
Are you listening?
It was you...
No.
I suppose I tried.
Yes.
Whatever you say, Dil.
I'd do anything for you, Dil.
Will I see you again?
Don't call me that --
I'm sorry, darling. I keep forgetting the leap year. What am I supposed to call you then, Jimmy?
What's that supposed to mean?
Carnations.
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
That's wise, Tommy.
Need to lose myself awhile.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
Suits you.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
Who's the old geezer?
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days.
What?
And who's Dave when he's at home?
Just a girl.
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
Can't.
I can smell her perfume.
Can't we take it off?
Only joking.
I'm not a gambling man.
What do you know about my nature?
What the fuck do you know about my people?
Why not?
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
Absolutely not.
I got sent.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
'Cause you're kind. It's in your nature.
Like having a pint in the Metro --
Depends on what you believe in.
I didn't.
You liked her?
Stop it --
A story.
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
But if I did... you wouldn't shoot a brother in the back --
What you say, faster?
Thought you liked me, bitch.
He's a good soldier, Jude.
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps.
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Ours.
Oh, I see.
Oh.
That's not Carson Dyle.
Carson?
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering $250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men --
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
Next, please.
No.
The last one, please.
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
Bartholomew?
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
But you're -- divorced?
No.
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
Alexander.
I'm not fifteen.
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
Who?
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
I don't think I know that one.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
That's right -- it's like ticklin' a alligator's belly.
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
Stop it!
I'm very confused.
Where did he keep his money?
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
No -- in my room.
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Peter Joshua.
Good for you.
Oh. I guess.
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
Don't you understand French?
Do you know what's wrong with you?
Nothing. Good night.
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --
Va jouer, mon ange.
But what?
I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
Don't you want me to stay?
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
As fucking if.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is.
She's my daughter, Tom.
Daddy you scared me!
It won't happen again.
A little.
You are upset.
What did you hear?
I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
Can you get inside?
I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
Shh. I'm not going to tell you not to go.
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
You gave me a 'D'.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
What party?
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
What?
Yes?
What?
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
His mother's side.
I guess so. Luckily we won't have that problem.
I got to go.
Hi Sandy.
Ok.
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Where's Sam?
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
...moron.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
Well, Darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  I could always give you that.
Yeah, to keep him off my ass.
I'm gonna stomp your a--
Shut...
Come on!
What the hell's goin' on?
Do you wanna give me a minute?
...town. 
No, you gotta go to McGrud-...
...-er.
You stole this truck!
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
Doesn't work.


...gun?!
...I'm not the psycho.
Hi--!  The gun was empty!
...you.
 
You  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, I'm--
Back up!  Back...

Oh, shit.
Come on, old Pete.
Left, left, left!
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
...Pete.  Come on.
...ho!

Hey!
Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
...stole the truck.
You know what I'm sayin'?
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
So I took his truck, yeah.
How wonderful for you.
...miles.
That is loud!  I'm 
You all right?

Arlo, shut up.
Reach into my pocket.


Come here.
You got Elvis?!
Sometimes the prey bites back.
Tunnel.
 
Forty-nine point four.
 It says forty- nine.



...-ta get outta here!
Hold this. 
Elvis is still in there!  It's gonna go off!
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
...-tiatin'.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was quick.
...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
Well, well, well.
But...
So...where's my truck?
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
 Look, I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.  Whatever you want.  Please!
  Hey, actually...
What the hell's a sage?
...owe you.
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
Exactly.
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
...including the permanently extreme.
I'd say we're about even.
No, sir.
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
You have my word on that.
Is this stool taken?
You look good, Richard.
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
...men every time I've closed my eyes?  But after you went away, I--
Forget about him.
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
Tell the choppers we're lifting off!
INT. U.S. RESEARCH LABORATORY/STORAGE AREA/FREEZER VAULT - NIGHT.

Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
We were called in by the Jerome base...

It must've happened right after we left.

INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
If that's what it says.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Very.
What for?
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
No. She's probably scared to death.
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
She's fine.
What is it?
How do you do that?
I have no idea. How much do you want?
Of course I do. Where are you?
Just bring your checkbook.
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Curly, where's your car?
Could you drive me somewhere?
I don't know...
Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too.
The apple core?
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
Gee, thanks, Lou.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
Of course.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
A complete surprise?
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
He told you?
She's cheating on him.
No reason.
Oh.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Of course I'm sure.
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
Is that unusual?
Why?
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
What were you doing there?
You can't always tell what's going on there.
Do? To who?
You bastard.
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
You're going to miss your train!  Lou, meet me at 1412 Adelaide. It's above Santa Monica Canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
What did you do that for?
Katherine?... Katherine who?
I have to go home and get my things.
He didn't wear bifocals.
When did you come in?
Okay.
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Help yourself.
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Drowned, too.
Now, Mrs. Mulwray, what seems to be the problem?
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Since lunch.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
Yes.
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
I'm working for his daughter.
She ran away?
Well, you never know, do you?
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
So I can have these? 
Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass all the way to China and back, let's make a deal. These strips here are yours, I give them to you. However! One  you're not to stick your nose in here any more. Two  I'll keep them for you, because you can't take them home for God forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now scram!
What you find tonight on the floor between the seats? 
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
But don't you like anything about what you do? 
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things...  That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before...  And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it...  And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth...  There is a woman.
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
Could be...But I don't like this business. It smells fishy to me.
Elena. My name's Elena.
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
You shouldn't tell me that now. After all these years!  I put all your things in here. Go in, go in...
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
Two cents.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
Sit down, everybody - for heaven's sake!
We certainly do.  Vacation's over - starting right after dinner.  But right now - that lady over there -  - that's the new society editor, I take it?  You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
Enthusiastic?
Yes, very!  Naturally.
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out.  He had that funny sense of humor.  And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so.  I guess he showed him all right.  He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer.  They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer.
Yes -
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
How do you do, Mr. Bernstein?
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
And the notice?
Is it good?
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
Please don't talk any more, Charles.
It may not be about anything at all.
I'm going to -  - 185 West 74th Street.
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
Toothache.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
Don't you worry about me.  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit.  The newspapers, for instance.  I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco...  It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason.  Aren't you, maestro? 
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
You're right.  We did lose a million dollars last year.
Yes, sir.
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
Lock it - and keep it locked.
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
People are going to know who's responsible.  And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly.  And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
Why not?
I'll get you some coffee.
What check?
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
I am in receipt of your favor of yesterday.  I beg you to do me the courtesy of accepting my assurance that Mrs. Whitehall cannot be induced to contribute any more information on the career of Charles Foster Kane. She has authorized me to state on previous occasions that she regards their brief marriage as a distateful episode in her life that she prefers to forget.  With assurances of the highest esteem -
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry?  That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry?
Yes, sir.
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
I had a toothache.
He married you, didn't he?
What about that apartment?
They haven't been tough on me.  I just lost my money.  But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
Are you serious?
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
I'll just take the gum.
This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that?
Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
Like I'm responsible for all the smokers!
The ones in this town, yes! You encourage their growth, their habit. You're the source in this area, and we're going to shut you down for good! For good, cancer-merchant!
Exactly.
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
I'll try to manage.
I'm not pregnant.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
How do you know that?
I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that.
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
You have a better suggestion?
How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date?
Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
Like what?
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
Um... I don't know.  What time did hockey end?
Yeah.
Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy neck on this ladder!
How 'bout covering point!? You suck!
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
So I'm told.
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Who was on your phone this morning at about two-thirty? I was trying to call for a half an hour.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
Seven months.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
That girl was vile to you.
It takes different strokes to move the world.
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
What about Veronica?
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
I think it's safe to say yes.
Empire.
Blasphemy.
It would stand to reason, yes.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.
All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with.  All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius.  You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living.
He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.
The milkmaids.
Because you buckled.
See? There you go again.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
I told him I had a game today. It's his own fault.
Can we not talk about this?
Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play.
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
How? When?
If you go, I go.
I can't close the store.
What, your dick?
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.
What?
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
I don't; you did.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
Shut the fuck up!
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
To talk to you.
Same time. What about you?
Thirty-fire.
I know I can bench more than that!
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
I didn't strain. I sighed.
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
We get off about the same time every night. We should hang out.  You get high?
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
All right. How much is Pepsi here?
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
Maybe.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
Meaning?
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Yeah, but...
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
How do you figure?
Something wrong?
Three.
Three?
Three including you.
Why do you say that?
You sucked his dick!
HOW MANY?
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
...it isn't there. Yes.
A couple...?
WHAT?
I didn't do that!
You said you were here all day?
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid!
He's your cousin?
English.  Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy.
No way!
Now feel his.  Roll up your sleeve, chief.
I like the way you think.
I hope it feels good.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
Dental School.
Twenty bucks.
Bye  That was Snowball.
Cursin'.  That's a penalty kick for unsportsmanlike conduct, mate.
I copy.
A monkey?
The money!
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
The clip's not gonna hold!
If you want, do it.  I don't care.
You keep it.  Get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
Hi, Gabe.
That's a virtue isn't it?
After the funeral I just had to leave.
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
I don't understand?
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Which could maybe what?
A flare up...
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
Where?
Making things real rough for Hal.
Call me sentimental.
Remember the first time we came up here?
I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
Next time, date only basketball players.
Forget it.  If that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  This way.
Never, what?!
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
What about you?
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
There is.
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
Doobidoob... a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A long night for growing malchicks... best not to say more. Bedways is rigthways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right.
Of course. Food alright?
Try the wine!
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
Just a manner of speech, sir.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
Do you still feel suicidal?
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Well, how are you then?
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy- wunching lomticks of toast.
No, brother. What d'you want?
No, sir.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Fine... fine.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
You felt ill this afternoon because you're getting better. You see, when we're healthy we respond to the presence of the hateful with fear and nausea. You're becoming healthy that's all. By this time tomorrow you'll be healthier still.
Fine. Fine.
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Yes?
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
How many did I get right?
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
It's a stinking world because there's no law and order any more. It's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you done. It's no world for an old man any more. What sort of a world is it at all? Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and there's not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more. The Tramp starts singing again.
You have, my son.
Indeed.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.
Prison custody?
Are you now, or ever have been, a homosexual?
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
Are you feeling better?
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
I'm...fine.  Fine.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
Most vividly.  "St. Louis Blues," "Potato Head Blues," "Sleepy Time Down South..."  ...then Pops laid some "Cornet Chop Suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
The crowd was most kind.  I was born in 1945, but my life began the night of July 22, 1964.  That was the moment of my conception.  Right here in this very room.
Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
You tell me.  I had to toss the list in the river.  I was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass.  So why don't you show a little courtesy?
By the way.  Daniel said he was sorry.
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
So?  It was a random thing.
Pick me up in five minutes.
This isn't our goddamn game!
Vincent...
What am I gonna do with flowers?
I'm standing right here.
<u>My hands are taped to the fucking </u> <u>steering wheel!</u>
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
You should start a union.
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
It's a spasm!  Jesus, Max, don't be such a girl...
How about the thingy next to it?
Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
What else calms you down?  Candy? Cigarettes?  Sex?  Breathe.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
How?
You're a cabby.  Like talk yourself out of a ticket?
So what?
Tell him next time he pulls any shit, you're gonna kick his fat ass.
Next time you pull any shit, I'm gonna kick your fat ass.
I don't understand...
I'm...what?  Sorry?
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
Jazz?  That's funny, coming from you.  Okay, some jazz for the jazz man. How's this?  I'll ask a question.
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
You'd do her a favor.
What happened?
What, no insurance?
Dmitri?
He's gonna <u>shoot</u> me?
When he finds out you tossed his list? I would.
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
It's not what you owe <u>me.</u> Time is so fleeting.  One day it's gone.  You make it out of this alive, Max, you really should call her.  That's what I think.
You're full of shit.
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
That's what you said...
...pie in the sky?  "Someday my dream'll come..."  But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old.  It hasn't happened.  It never will.  Life just flipped on you.  Tomorrow became yesterday.  Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life...  Don't talk to me about murder.  You're <u>do-in</u>' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday...
Vincent?
Excuse me?
Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
Mississippi?
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
No.
Switch the charts.
For what?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.
Yes.
Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
Are these yours?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Shoot.
That was him.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
What?
Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Love at first sight?
To Jonas.  I didn't know that at the time.  Didn't know who he was.  But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else.  So I started watching your father.  I wanted to keep him safe.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
Because he believed me.
You saw me standing alone ...
I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me.  <u>Now</u>.
Now she tells me.
Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
<u>Liza</u>!
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
Whatever.
You were going to ask about my nose.  The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
And you feel bad for it?
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
Terminal?
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza.  What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions.  We're out.  Shut off. Terminated.  <u>Understood</u>?
Wait --
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
Your call.  Have a good night.
He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
He died...  ... in 1972.
Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode.
Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
Tell me.
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
Ellie...
Meaning...
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years.  As for why...  I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
What?
This is how you see the sky?
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
Many others.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...
Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her.  And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out.  That's Paris, where my daughter was born.  Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking.  So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang.  As if it never happened.  If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely.  Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which:  How're you getting on with the old man?
And?
I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing.  Still, we've barely started...
Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
Greenbank?
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
Did you love him?
Why?
Really.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
What is it?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
Buck is a deal.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
No.
She took off with that convertible feller...
Ram it in and break it off!
He's probably a gigolo.
I... I... I...
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Borrowin'.
I kin see that, brick head. I mean your hole card.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
Shut up. Let him eat. Don't pay them no mind, boy.
Get away!
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
Well, whatta we got here?
You tryin' to say somethin'?
That's what you're gonna have to do.
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
Like an elephant.
Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
We ain't goin' nowhere.
But what am I gonna do all by myself?  Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
Why sure, Luke. I mean I didn't talk to them about that. But why not? They're reasonable, Luke. Hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
That fool. That damn fool.
Well, how far didya get?
Fat mile'n a half. Hit this red light, highway patrol pulls up alongside.
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
When was the last time you washed your hair?
But earlier, he was staring up here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
Hal has it.
Oh, God, uniforms, more stress. Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting: she hyperventilates till she passes out, then her breathing goes back to normal, and she wakes up singing like a lark.  We know, don't we, Princess?  Give her a couple of hours.  I know about this.
Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...
I thought he was lying.
The same as the first time...
When he was seventeen.
I don't have it...
You already made the delivery?
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
You come and visit.
In jail.
Who was the man in the basement?
Oh, I think you will.
Where it began -- McCluskey Auditorium.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
Is he out?
What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
Inspector Halloran, that is so much bullshit, you don't like or admire me, but the beautiful part is I don't give a fuck.  That's the upside of having a breakdown.
I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used their own stockings to strangle them.  Tied in a bow-knot.
I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
Maybe you should...
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
Let me get a little action started here.
Not yet.
I know, baby.  I know.
Someone broke into her place last night.  It wasn't connected to our case, but it shook her up pretty bad so I haven't...
We know Helen.  She's not exactly a credible collaborator.  Especially late in the day...
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
Let's get out of here...
Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at this...
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
Talk to Nikko...!
I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
Right.
What are you looking at that for? Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.
Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.
I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
Thank you.
Well, yes.  You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk.
Do you find him attractive?
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
They said it was here. They told me this morning.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
I can drive.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
What?
What?
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
But everything's OK?
You're slowing.
I know.    I know.
I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
Terrific.
No.
And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
I wish I could have seen that.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
I do.
Michael, I...
Home free.
I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
Aren't you ever quiet?
Very trendy. Let's see the rest.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
You're so wrong.
I'll see you tonight.
You, too. Kick ass today.
You've got one hell of a great body.
Congratulations.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
What?
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
Yeah.
Sure. Why?
I think you're overreacting.
Are you all right?
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
That's a load off my mind.
What?
Sure, I understand.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
I'll float you.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
What about me? Aren't I a loose end?
Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.
It's Elvis...
The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family.
No thank you.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
He missed three weeks.
He's recorded every conversation he's had with you for years.
Thank you.
If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
Why do I have to pick up the tapes.
Cops?
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
Has to be.
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
Does it really matter what I say?
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
What do you want now?
How much?
Fine.     Ten o'clock.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
Okay boss.   Where are they?
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
What room number?
Oh yeah.
There must be half a million dollars here though.
I'm the driver.
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
We both know I'm already dead.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
Mr. Taylor?
No!
You see that car?
No thank you.
Yeah, I dig him.
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
You wanna tell him?
Take a nap.
The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
You got it in a bar?
No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
Sounds boring.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be worth something. Someone gave it to me. C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good here.
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
I didn't have the heart.
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
What's it to you?
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
I owe you nothing.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
Maybe it is.  I wouldn't know.
Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
I'll give them to you.
Only the sword will settle this.
All right.  Hurry.  I will hold on as long as I can.
And so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  He couldn't find the stars, so he stole my comb.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
Yes.
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
Then, why did you come?
Your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... All this time, I've never had the courage to touch it.
I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
I don't know...
The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.
This is special, darlin'.  Please?
Don't thank me.
You don't say.
I saw it, too.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
Not me.
In a better place.  I hope.
I don't know you.
You don't even remember...
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine.
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
Annette Harrison.
From who?
You did?
It's not really important.
You talking to me?
That's a matter of opinion.
You need help.
Give me the fucking letter.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
Why are you doing this?
Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.
Get off me.
Hi.
It was perfect.
Why aren't you understanding?
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
Ben Schwarz.
The football stud?
Outstanding.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
That's great.
Do you want to learn or not?
What do you mean?!
I... I don't think you want to know.
Why didn't you do something?
What do I do then?
I look terrible.
But -
Prude.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
I know.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
It works a little.
Honey, is something wrong?
Did you do everything I asked you to?
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
Be more specific.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Blow me.
No.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
Who are you spying on?
She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
I want to fuck.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
Ronald?
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
I think you have your answer.
It's Cecile.
Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
Do you know when she'll be back?
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
Did she show up?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we used to do them every year — St. George and the Dragon, all kinds of sword dances.
How?
Yes, darling.
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
The Farren house
Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
Irena.
All right, mommy.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
Yes, darling,
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
You do that, Edward.
Did you mail then?
But, Amy, that was just a story; it wasn't real.  That tree's no mailbox.
But this is different.  Go on blow,
Voices from an old dark house!
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
Yes, Amy?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
But where do you come from?
I shall want you for always.
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
It's a pretty ring.
I can't do it! I can't do it!
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
What else is there?
Mom!
What does that have to do with me?
Your shrink always gives you bad advice. He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
I'd kill for just a little bloated.
Frida, grab that red one.
And she got the medium.
Why would they exaggerate?
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
We almost slept together... and... then the hair started and I booked.
It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
And he was missing an arm.
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
Yeah, I guess. Mark?
Why not? There's been a murder.
Why the fuck would you do that?
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
No. I won't let you do that.
Sure. See ya.
Hey, how about a little nightcap?
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
Oh come on. Knock it off.
You don't have to pee.
Frida, you know you're it for me.
It's Mark.
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
So what book did you buy?
The weird thing is I've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
Goodnight.
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
Interesting possibility.
I love you too.
Okay.
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe he got lucky.
She's my best friend. I gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. She's lonely. If pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
Yeah, sorry. Uh... Gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
I told you she was innocent.
And he was missing an arm.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Thanks.  Just some pills.
The other one?
Sorry, sir.
Wrong?  Look at this!
I woke up in a subway.  I don't know how I got there.
Asks my name.  Over and over.  Just like a broken record.  Only thing is, I can't answer.  I've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
That's what people keep telling me.
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
Anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
How do you know I'm innocent?
Right.
Is this dangerous or anything?
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
I mean,  if it's a problem...
Well it's a last minute change.
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Bob, the guy had a stroke!
Nobody's got clean kids.
Are you out of your mind?
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
What I told him to?
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
Then we'll all go to jail together.
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
I don't think so.
Alan...
Oh... Thanks.
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
My wife was my campaign manager. We had a two thousand dollar budget.
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
Of course.
I had a feeling.
`Bleed for your king.'
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
They asked me to help.
I'm not Bill Mitchell.
What?
I know. I'm sorry...
Hi.
Father Mclntire.   He blessed you at the inauguration.
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
I don't believe you, rebel. Where are your headquarters? On the mainland?
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
Gasparilla?
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
I detest all my sins...because... because of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish...
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
No, sir.
Not as bad as yours, pal.
To fucking Mutt.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
I don't think they're in school.
Yeah.
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
Sure.
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
I'm one of the proofers.  I slipped the article in.
I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
No.
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
Just like that?!  You just knew?
Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
Then come with me.
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
It's just for a little while. You promised.
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time.  Why does the poet write these lines?
Courtyard?
YAWP!
AHHHHHH!
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
I'm calling her!
Nothing.  No mention of it.
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
What is it?
My brother went here.
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
Todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up.  The meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into Harvard. know what I mean?
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
I'll come to the performance.
I don't know.
Yes.
What the hell are you talking about?
And where is our point of arrival?
You're going to have to get a new one.
Just trying to get to my boat...
The thieves.
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
On the side!!
Takes one to know one.
A meat locker.
Why don't you just stop figuring and keep working so we can get the hell out of here?
You don't give a shit about anything do you?
Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
I have been.
There ain't no thing here!! No thing!! There's you him and me!! Got it! You him and...
Hey! Fuckin' A!
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you must be tired.
Oh, sure... Twice a day.
What hospital is he in? Where?
No.
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
Thanks.
Naw.
Yeah?
Oh, well...
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
What?
I don't know.
I... No. You do this for money?
Right here.
Yeah.
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
Yeah.
Yeah... I guess.
From Nam?
Pow.
From Nam?
Yeah... I mean so he knows... He doesn't even know.
Get off your ass, Nick. Get off your fucking ass and stand up!!!
Merle...
Here! This is it!
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
We do, Sal. We do... You're the heart.
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
Yeah.
Where?
Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty weird... Lives alone, lives way out in the middle of nowhere with a cat called Pajamas and a cow called Fred. Well, last week I got a call from Phantom Mary, which in itself was very strange...
Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one of those slants?
I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
Down ribbon!
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
Give it to me.
Out of the room.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
Not anymore.
We have to talk.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Are you a cop?
Technothugs.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
Take a look at this.
Well I've got news for you.  This dirty cop was the <u>only cop</u> who could bag Doucet.
Seat's too high.
Haven't seen you around.  Where have you been all my life, handsome?
No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
You know that you're in my house.
That's my problem, Belle.
All right, Daniel. Jump in.
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
All right, darling.
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
Opportunities?
Oh, certainly. I shan't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste.  But I may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake's sake. Yes, I might do that.
Yes, I did -- but you tricked me into signing it! You told me my soul was nothing ... that I could forget all about a soul, in exchange for money. That was a lie, a lie, a lie.
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
Not at all, lad -- not at all.  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
You really think so?
The only one you missed -- is the President.
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
I'd love to.
Tired?
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
Jabez --
Oh -- Jabez.
Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes.  Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
Mary!
Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
Sure, Ma.
Belle, give the Sheriff a cup of rum.
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.
Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
Are you, Mary?  Well, I guess I'm glad myself -- seeing as how you feel this way.  Party seems to be quite a success.  Lots of guests, anyhow.
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
I object.
You can talk to me ...
I'll find someplace.
How about his job?
Ellis, what have you told them?
And if he alters it...?						*
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
So I've heard.
Yeah.  I remember our first date.
I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
-- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio!
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
What about the kids?
Heidi, I'm dying.
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
It looks like a whole roast.
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
I'm sorry...
Well...
Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there.
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you.
Call me whatever you want.
I frisk you?
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
I want to see my wife.  I want you to bring her down here.
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here ...
He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 
Do what the gentleman says, Howard.
Okay, don't worry about it.  Stick it in the bag...
You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split.  Otherwise, you go with us.
I'm not going.  I'm okay.
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
I'll be God damned if you will.
Yeah?
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
I'm glad it's okay.
Hey.  It's raining.
Do you remember anything else about Sal?
No, that's all.
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
Get 'em in the vault!
Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?
How'd that happen?
Get over there!
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
Okay.
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
Okay, when do I get them?
I have to see.
I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
Okay.  Which one goes?
I speak what I feel.
It's not a joke.  I got this terrible fear of being locked in...
I forgot she's in here.
... Just give me time to think...
Sonny - Here's your document.
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
Oh my God, mother!
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
Doing what?
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.

How come you ain't got no brothers up?
No, you the man.
OK, but listen up.  I'm gonna break it down.

Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
I'm just not ready.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
You're it.
No.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Oh, of course.
And nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
Yeah, go-cart accident.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.
I didn't know that.
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
They can't be real.
Oh! Ho! Okay. You wanna go?
Ow... What do you want to do, HARRY?
Wanna bet?
Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now.
Shut up!
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
The answer is George Jefferson.
Hey, let's go spy on them.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
I don't know who we are anymore.
And like she said, do it before the parade.
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
PRINCIPAL COLLINS is a greater American than George Washington will ever be.
Damn! What are the odds?
Well, what should we do?
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Oh, you're good.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
I don't know what you're talking about.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
HARRY and I have been talking about school. In fact, I want to ask you something.
Me too. I'm almost there.
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
He passed away three years ago.
I reckon so.
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
What the hell are you talking about?
Small potatoes. This one is big time. This is visionary. This idea is genius.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
We start our own class?
Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
It's a surprise.
I don't know where it is. It's not here. It's been stolen.
Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
Yes.
Not sorry enough.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
Usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the Fedaykin.
My father sent you to test me. Music then?
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
Certainly.  But now the children of the night are calling me.
Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this production.
Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
Nah.  This happens all the time...

I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
Really?  I don't feel so great.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
If you say so.
Rolling.
These shoes are itchy.
NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!
And who may you be?
I made it up.  It's horseshit!
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
It takes me comfortable.
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
But there's plenty of other parts.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
I can't wait to take a look.  So what's up next?
Doctor Acula?  I don't get it.
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
It's plenty!  It's the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I'll just find a double to finish his scenes, and we'll release it as "Bela Lugosi's Final Film"
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Mm, not good-lookink enough.
I think you're quite handsome.
Hopefully, very soon.  I'm just awaiting the final okay from Mr. Feldman at MGM.
But Greta say --
The food will make you feel bedder. Look at me -- I'm da happiest guy I know!
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
So you're not gonna make the movie?
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
Confidentially, I even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I'll tell ya, I wasn't scared of being killed, but I was <u>terrified</u> of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.
Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
Oh, hi.
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
Dynamite --
Hell, if I did, I wouldn't have any friends.
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
Yes?
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
You know, you're a very attractive girl.
At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
Well, now I will. He was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch.
Where is she? Is she all right?
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Yeah?
Are the TV people with you?
No. It's a mess.
Oh my God!!
Holy sh--
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
I'm at the hospital.
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Why? How...
Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
Shari, Ray feels --
What is she, at work?
She left.
All right. Let them decide.
Our what?
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
Never would be plenty.
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
Who's in it?
Why do it?
Dynamite is dangerous.
Right.
Okay ...
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
It's quite an honor. Will you come with me?
Shari, I really like you...
Everybody hates me!
I'm sorry.
Come on, let's go.
...yeah?
No. It's your fault.
Come on.
It's nice.
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
What are you drunk?
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
Thumbsucker!
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
Yeah.
Marcia's living with a singer?
Oh, Jesus.
What's the dif --
"Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
What?... Why?
Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.
Ed?
She's incredible.  Everything just gets soaked.
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Yeah, just --
See, it doesn't add up. There are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two votes are missing. Check the register.
But, Mr. M. -
Yes, I do.
Hey, that's super
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Okay, fine. Sure
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
You're off the hook. Tammy here has confessed.
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
You'll be fine.
I hope so
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
Exactly when?
Door was open.
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
Should we get a what?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
We'll let it run awhile
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
Three twenty-five.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
I was lonely.  You took advantage
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
Larry, you just take it easy
Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...
Yeah.
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Yeah.
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
What'd I do?
You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
Yeah, plain scotch.
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
What was that boyfriend's name?
I came home that night and there was blood on the floor.  Susan said Stams -- Stens had cut himself.  They were acting nervous.  And that Stens kept going under the house.
Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
Richard Stensland.
No.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop cocksucker.
I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
What do you want to know?
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
Clean?
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
Yeah.  My whole life.
It's a simple question.
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
Decorated?
No.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
You cut to the heart of things, don't you?  What about Lynn Bracken?  She going to be a hooker all her life?
Some reality.
Why not?
Do you have any proof?
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
A bootleg...
Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Yes.
Nothing.
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Turn on CNN.
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
A direct one.
I don't know who he is.
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
Yeah.
It's a SAT-tracker.
Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
No shit.
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
I didn't use my name.
I called from a payphone!
You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
None of your business.
How'd you get around the tap orders?
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
They come after you?
They're here.
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
You sure?
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.
What are you saying?
Are you sure about this?
With what?
Anytime.
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
What kind of trouble.
Just for the criminals.
It's okay.
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
It's not real...  That's not me.
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
That's okay.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
I don't believe it is, no.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
Other than me.
You got a minute?
You being audited?
That's temporary.
We're screwed.
Tell me about Brill.
You have to.
Merry Christmas, son.
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
I don't under--
Some of 'em.
Who won the fight?
No "900" numbers.
Did they take your clothes?
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
Go fuck yourself.
It's been a few years.
Yeah, what's going on?
What the hell does it mean?
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
Help from whom?  Christ.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
No.
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
Excuse me.
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it?
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
I'm quite all right, thank you.
Good.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
It's a folk song.
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
Yes.  A different wife.
Don't go over it again, please.
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
Portraits.  The Brigadier, the Brigadier's wife, the Brigadier's dogs, the Brigadier at the Pyramids, the Brigadier breathing.
Why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
I see.
Count Laszlo de Almásy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
Bermann!
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
Okay.
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
It is you.  This was taken in Cairo at British Headquarters - July 41. And so was this - August 41.  And this -February 42.
It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
Are you Hana?
Yeah, for a while.
So you can shoot a pistol?
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
What?  How could he have?  When?
I think that's called looting.
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
I see.
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
I can see my wife in that view.
That's a different dress.
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
So one day we'll meet.
He can't even move.
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
No.  He's - no.
Oh God.  Oh God.
Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL! Hana stops. 
I don't think so.
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Interesting theory. Where's the proof?
I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
Don't overestimate yourself.
I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
Uh, yes.
It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
Good. I'll call the concierge. They can get you a new room, book your flight home, so forth.
Not a word.
I never carry...baggage.
We go underwater?
Try laps. Say a hundred.
Our equipment has arrived.
It was a long time ago.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
It's a party.
What?
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
Right. The eight billion.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Call it a new tradition.
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
That's because you grew up rich.
FUCKING THING!!!
Get out of here!
But--
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
You gave them the eight billion.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Always in a rush.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
You look like George Washington.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
Call it an expression of trust.
I figured that out.
Don't use language with me --
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
You're kidding, right?  Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG&E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions.
Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.
All of them.
Jesus.
Yes?
You're a lawyer?
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
Excuse me?
Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
They skipped that step.
What do you mean?
Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right.
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
Whoa.  No shit.
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
Did he say why?
What do you mean?
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you.  People are dying, Ross.  You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it.  I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
There's more than one kind?
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
I'm gonna hate it.
Which number do you want, George?
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day?  That's a fascinating subject.
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
I don't do favors for you anymore.
I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
What?
You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Barks his agreement.
Yeah ...
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit it that hard.  It must have had a self-destruct ....
I'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
Good.
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
That's quite a compliment.
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
Who's staring?
Repairs ...
Not really.
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
Not actually .... Our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. Most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
What are you talking about?
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
But tell me why ...
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
My mind fills with so many images.
It is the future you see.
If it must be.  Yes.
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
Yes, but don't take any chances.
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
Are we going to eat soon? I'm starved.
He's... near.
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
Cuervo, look out behind you!
Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
Locked.
Who? You mean Cuervo Jones? He's the man with the juice, Snake. Got the President's daughter. Setting up a citywide truce. Big doings.
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
We'll see.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
Looking to get out.
A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.
Who?
You need help.
--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
Move aside!
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
What book is that?
The dragon! There...
...of course...
Good and evil; there is never one without the other.
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
So be it.
Without Lancelot?!
And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?
Twenty days!? The world is that big?
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
Talk. Lovers murmuring to each other...
I swear it.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
Well what's wrong?
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
In here!
Dinner at the White House.
Just five or six people.
What's Burke got to do with it?
Me too.
Want to ask him?
Really? wow.
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
How are you today?
Lies?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
Are you sure?
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
Harvard, Bellevue, John Hopkins.
Well, the first thing I'd do is put them into a time macine and send them back to the sixteenth century.
Why, I don't understand?
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
What do you drink?
What?
Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
Oh............
We'll see Regan.  Now about those party invitations.......
I found it.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Mr. Dennings?
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Your not gonna marry him are you?
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Well your thinking's not so good.
Okay.
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
St. Mike's.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
What we missed in the EEG and the arteriogram could conceivably turn up there. At the least, it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
Who's in it?
I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
Uoy era ohw.
Oh really, when?
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
Save your servant
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
I once did a paper on it
Is that a threat?
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Be silent!
O'Lord hear my prey.
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
Yes I am her brother, he's the son
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
Who is it?
I'm afraid.
Teeth.
How will he eat?
When they coming in?
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
Fuck him.
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
You got weird kids, Frank.
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
We gotta go, Jack.
It wasn't like that.
No?
No.
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
Get out of here!
I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.
Here, how's this?
So what do you think?
Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Two years ago.  March.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
All night?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, she's our girl now.  I think we better keep an eye on her.  There's trouble there.  Hey, listen to this.  Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years.  You believe that?
Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.  And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
Be reasonable, Jack.
Seventy-one
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
What?
Who's weak now, big brother?
Right.
I'll take the Mallory.
Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
She asked for it.
Just call me a cab.
Well, that's fine --
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Nine.
Uh... good.
You're a prince.
I said I was sorry.
Did you hear it?
Great?
Huh?
Uh ...
What're you talking about?  They love it.
Yes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night like this.
I'll call you.
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
Not for money. With my mother.
I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.
Forget it.
In and out.
Just dinner and dance, right?
What'd I say?
Nothing.
Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit!
Must've been a cheap date.
No kidding?
Long story.
Vegetables.
Another five years, huh?
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
The recent past.
How do you know?
Looks old.
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
Not so good.
That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
Right ... like Jon Archer would ever let that happen.
Like ...
For being one helluva guy.
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
I don't know ...  Maybe because you've never needed my help.
And you wouldn't be.
Whatever happened, whatever he did -- I know it's my fault and I know I can never make it up to you --
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
Go on.
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Don't count on it.
Not anymore.
Too late, your kid worships me.  And your wife -- she's an animal.  Even I can't keep up with her.
Not if I kill you first ...
I'm going to have you fired.
Pollux is -- what?
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
Or what?  You'll have me fired?
Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
You mean like ... condoms?
Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
I'm just having some fun.
Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!
Normally, I would.  But today ...
Jon, you're starting to remind me -- of me.  Congratulations.
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
I disagree.  You think I've been acting strange.  Like a completely different person.
Ooh, my suits are ready...
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
I’m sure you do...
What about me?
What’s going on here?
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
You know how to make chocolate milk?
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
Five thirty.  Okay.
Big Ed’s.
Like what?
Ringing my bell...
Is it...?
Kate’s my wife...
She wants to have an affair with me.
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
The Caddy?  Why don’t you take your own damn car!
Yes you do...
I call all you white guys "Jack."
Hey...
You still think this is about me, don't you?
That’s my car!  You stole my car!
No?  C’mon, Jack...I’ve got everything I need, I don’t have regrets, that’s just not for me... sound familiar?
Something like that.
Right, for us. But...I’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Because that’s where I live.
Party?  Oh no, I can’t go to a party...
Telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
...my feet are hurtin’...
Well that’s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, there’s no question about that.  But this...  ...you’ve really grown into a beautiful woman...
Sure.  I really like Annie.
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Why’d we ever leave?
You can’t really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
Sorry, Jack.  It’s too important to me.
C’mon, you know what I like to hear...
Zeena...
I’ll fix it.  I’ll go out right now and get you something.  I’ll make it right.
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
I don’t think I’d fight you on that one...
For the week?
What are you talking about, Jack?
I’m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
Please, just promise me you’ll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you don’t, then it’s like it never happened and I don’t think I could live with that.
That’s the one...
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
I need you, tiger..
That’s easy. You’ve seen my car.
Kate? No, there’s no one here named Kate.  Is that good enough for you?
Of course I did.
No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
He <u>also</u> said we'd avoid that storm in space.  And we know how that turned out.
Well why didn't you say so?  You want me to lift some weights or something?
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
No, it's not.  I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
And they're changing into...
I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
What about you?
Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!
Is that a trick question?  C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
<u>Girl</u>...?!
Blockhead started it!
As soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. Come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. You think those people out there <u>care</u> about you?  You're just a <u>fad</u> to them.
Reed's <u>always</u> right.  Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
It's not just the money.  I could make money in my sleep.
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
<u>I</u> ruined?  With all due respect, I told you to abort --
It's been changed.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
And reverse the mutations --
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he <u>likes</u> having his prize specimen under glass...  It's ironic, isn't it?  You're finally the perfect woman for him...because you're his <u>science project</u>.
Let's find what the devil's holding them up!  Contact the Proteus!
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
And take a little trip with them...
It's only for an hour --
He's blanked out on that one particular point.
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
With no laser --
No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
But big enough for us...
And if it should take more time to get through --
What gives you that idea?
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
I've done all I could with the laser.
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
You mean Inner Space is endless?
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
A forced joining of an Artery and Vein. Must've happened when Benes was hurt.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Why not? Because of his gibberish about GOd and the Soul? Camouflage -- that's all it is -- to blind the gullible like you! And to hide his real identity -- a fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes! And you made it possible!
Sort of.
They can't reduce nuclear fuel. But once the Reactor's Miniaturized -- along with the submarine -- a microscopic particle should emit enough energy to activate it.
Berserk nothing. He's the one who's been sabotaging the mission...  Get this on. Hurry!
What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
Was there any damage?
Not to the valve. But we've lost too much air to make it the rest of the way.
Fluid is seeping through. Better come down and have a look!
What's this, sir?
What?
I did.
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
So why don't you just ask him for the money?
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
Yah, but that TruCoat -
Yah.
White Bear Lake?
Just a general way.
Chaska.
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
Yah, that can happen.
Yah, right -
They're gonna call, give me instructions for a drop. I'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
Yah.
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch. I'll let you get back to your paperwork, then.
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Yah, so we're all set.
Yah, how much money was that?
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Yah.
Yah.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Stan Grossman called.
Yah, okay.
You told me about it.
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
We might be innarested.
...Huh?
We're good to loan in.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
Yah.
Ya gotta eat a breakfast...
Yah, that's me.
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
Well, they're a good outfit.
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
Margie Olmstead?
What'd he say?
Yah.
Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
We've got a -
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
Not on your feet too much?
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Yah.
The first rule of Project --
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
You need to make these your primary "action items."
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
This is... really a shock...
Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying.  But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying.
Practicing what?
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
Yeah.
I want brain parasites.
The girl had done her homework.
That's the idea -- we split them.
Please.
I don't know.
That... sawing and hammering.
What did you say... ?
What... ?
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
You have to get out of here.  Leave as soon as possible.  Go to any rural town, away from any major city...
I'm sorry, but I...
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
What?
Nine time out of ten, it's an electric razor.  But, every once in a while ...  ...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.  We use the indefinite aricle: "A dildo."  Never "Your dildo."
You're a tourist.  I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
Somehow, I realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about Marla Singer.
Pardon me?
And, now it's gone.
What list?
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Yeah.
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
Go ahead.  Say it.
This fight, pussy.
Alive or dead?
Any historical figure.
He was obviously able to handle it.
I don't know...
Nothing.  Do what you like.
I thought you did.
An expired community college student ID card.  What did you used to study, Raymond K. Hessel?
No.
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
What are you doing?!
... is over.
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
What... ?
What are you talking about... ?
What about Marla?
You... you can't be serious about this.
I'm going to...
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
If you know, I know.
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
You will.  You know you will.
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
Appreciate something.
Very good, Sir.
Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
No!
Yes, it is.
Please, God, no...
You were there?
So let's do it.
Yeah, fuck 'em.  No offense.
He probably already knows we're coming.
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
Yeah, you should have specified.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
But why single me out?  What am I in the great scheme of things?  You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man.
Yeah, so what happened?
You're not listening to me!  You have to do something!
Do you remember what triggered it all?
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
I know.  I can feel it too.
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
Right. April 25th.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to die! Gods don't die! We do!
"Next?"
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
I know who you are.
Design?
That's what I'm doin'!
Huh?
No.
Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.
Star Wars?
You stopped.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
You never been in one of those things.
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Why's that?
Intelligence work.
Why'd they want us?
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
I do?
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
I'm not jumping blind.
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
What did you want?
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
But now it's free, right?
Do I look like I have someone special?
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
I was attacked.
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
But..How could that happen?
He and his wife was were at some bar ..and some nut came in with a shotgun and blew the place apart. She was a beautiful girl...She never knew what hit her.
Come on now...You can't sit here.
Yes... I... I agree...
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
No, I have to work.
Which ones?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.
Sshhhh!
A quest?
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
The Red...?  You're totally gone, aren't you?
Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
Serveza yourself!
Now, now.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
You treat me like I was.
Well, is that a happy face I see?
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
No. How much do I owe you?
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
I always tell everyone the same thing. I got rolled and beat up real bad recently, and since then it's two for one, an' I work strictly in tandem with Betty...
Thank you...  Oh no, don't put it on there...
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
Oh, well, what, what's he...
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
Yeah, well, he's...
You were going without saying goodbye?
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
And you no longer play at all?
Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
I gave it a second thought.
You don't call that music, though.
Then I must have been supplying it.
I don't think that's accurate...
That's right.
Will you let me talk to you, please?
Catherine...
Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
Suit yourself. But I'll tell you, where we're headed is gonna get colder'n hell.
Not at all.
Well, I should hope not...
Hold onto this.
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
Look at me.
Alright.
I'm wit' Carlos.
I, umm, came to see you.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
I can't, I'm gonna get punished more!
What you want with her anyway'
You said before, that he got boxes?
You gonna talk to him?
Um, yeah I think so.
Yeah.
A girl named Amanda.
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
So, then whadda ya want?
Jus' from around the way.
You're kidding.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
Fletch, this is dumb.
I busted their window, they didn't do anything.
Not luck. They don't want me.
Not a prayer.
Thank God, the police.
Go ahead. Make my evening.
That's two.
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Well, which one?
Oh, he was dying for years.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
Like tonight.
Fletch...
Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens things up around here, don’t you?
For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy gave me a deposition.
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch?
I'm fine.
Until she remarries, Fletch.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
My lawyer was a bum.
This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Till then.
Where are you going?
No problem.
Why don't you try suicide?
Get me on the first shot, if you can.
I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
Only if you promise not to return me.
Not me.
Only one way to find out.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
Hi.
Here, take mine.
Can I ask you a question?
Depends on the question.
Why'd you let me in?
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
How come?
Long story.
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
What?
Mattress police. There are no tags on the mattress. I'm going to have to take you downtown. Please give me your weapon.
Go ahead. Call them. Better tie your shoelaces first.
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
I have some ideas.
Go to transportation, get a ticket.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Forget it.
Not really.
My secretary.
I said, I ain't got you...
I ain't -- got -- you.
Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich.  The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me.  When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
Let's see, you're her worried sister.  Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Nuthin'.
Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now.
Thanks, I needed that.
Right away!
All your friends call you Jazz.
Exactly.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
I like.
I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
Wha --
Hey, they blew me.
Give me your gum and grab the wheel.
Ye-ah.
Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
Who cares?  I got a case.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
Shut the heck up... Pop.
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
What's fine?
The case!
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Let me go out like a man.
I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Oh God, please, <u>don't</u>!
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
Just find her, man.  She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my mother, she's some little brat I stood in line with at Taco Bell last week.  Do whatever you want with my words.  And my money.
Boca?
B.O.C.A.
Got a wife named Angie.
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Non!
Sois gentil avec lui.  On ne sait jamais.  Il peut te faire travailler à la télévision.
What happens to the schedule?
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
You're for real?
He got off on six.
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
It was a crematorium.
Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
I been damn careful up to now.
So what?
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
Switches are shorted out.
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
I'd go with you and Chinese take-out over her any time.
He did.
I'm serious.
Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy...
Frank...
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
No, I don't.
Do you know where I found this?
No.  This isn't what you think.
Frank, please...
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
I'm right here behind you...
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
Whatta ya know.  Bayside, born and raised.
I got fed up with all the bullshit.
Hello?
What'd you just say?
Oh, that was my kid.
Uh huh...
What?
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
What if it's not...
I think I'm losing you.
She's not here.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now.  How?
What kinda twisted animal.
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
What?
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
Huh?
Dad, you there?
Longbranch...?
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
What?
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
As a matter of fact, I caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the Nightingale murders.
I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming.  And I'm gonna steal your life away.  You went down 30 years ago.  You just don't know it yet.
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
Where are you going?
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
I'll think of something.
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
Did you stay here last night?
No.  I got here just before you did.
Somebody was in here.
Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
Sort of.
Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
Not us!  He's really creepy.
Everything's gonna be fine.
May be please have the wallet.
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
You're wrong.
Alright, alright.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
Sheriff, you better take this.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
And make sure my daughter stays put...  ...She's grounded.
I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until...
Wait a minute. I just...
It probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  The only sure way to stop Jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
Lake Forest Green?
Why?
Huh?
We'll scare 'em right back.
Shhh...You know what I used to do when I was a little girl when I got scared?
Boy scouting.
No...Did Megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
He didn't say anything?
Don't piss me off, junior.  Or I will repaint this office with your brains.
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
I've seen it.
If I had you where I really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
I'm here.
I'm kind of busy right now...
Look --
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
You need to leave.
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
Tell me.
Tell me!
Have a good night.
Yeah...
Then why were you at her house?!  She didn't want anything to do with you.
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
Look, I know I treated her bad --
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
I'm literally going to kill you!
You're joking, right?
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
This is Jason's fault!
Nothing.
Walking corpses are not real!
My niece's life hangs in the balance right now!! Every second counts.
She didn't push me into coming.
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
I...I can't...
I was only trying to teach you. But I pulled you out, Rennie. I saved your life.
Just felt a little chill.
Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
There's something I haven't told you...
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
We changed our minds.
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
But Rennie...
Shut up, Elliot.
Press a button and they give us money.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Tonight. What's tonight?
That was a big mistake.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
Classic.
Yes. What are you implying?
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
You know about Adele.
What about her?
The Red Sox
In and out of bed.
We don't even like each other, do we?
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
Everything.
Daddy, wait.
First you tell me.
Mystery. Deception.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Yes.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
Washed away.
Nicky comes on Sunday's.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
You know the answer to that.
I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
Show him who we are.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
They're my team.
I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
What color?
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
I kissed her while she was laughing.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
And he has finer moments now and then.
Endearing.
Home.
No one's waiting.
I don't want you, Steven.
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
One more.
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
I think if we all worked to publicize it... all of the Congress... every avenue we know.
Wait and see... wait and see...
I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
I don't know... I know you are right. I don't know that this is right.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
Not true!  The secret is mastering the urge.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
It's split the Government.
Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
Grudges?
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
We don't have the manpower.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
So we have two choices.  Either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don't know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  We test again.  You're right, Hugo, this was a desperate act.  Someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I'd like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
I will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  We're already counting backwards.
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway.  It may as well pay my rent.
You know I'm scared of heights.
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
They'll recognize me.
If you say so.  The stripe.
Michael's.
I was never very good at it, remember?
--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
I have to caution you it's not fool-proof. With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
I've found him too.
Last night?  I was at home.
Why don't we say we were together?
They found an eyelash.
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
Those checks take forever.
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?  He's a big fan of yours.  He wants to apply here.
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
Honey, you've made <i>one</i> mistake--
Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
I'll take care of my end.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
No way. I've got to get out now.
I've been doing my homework.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
No. It's been a long time.
We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
Should be light traffic that time of day... the Bank Guard carries a .38. These will stop an M.2 at fifty yards.
My mind's not on guessing games.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
I don't want to go there.
I can handle it.
Not now.
I don't want to hear it.
Things can't get much worse can they?
You and me.
Whatever you say.
So what?
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
Just sandwiches...
He took the day off.
Just fine.
I don't report the car and I don't know either of you?
Can he trust you?
I Just want to find a suitcase.
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
Did Eric Pake pull her?
When did you find out?
Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
I had to. It was the only way I could get at them.
That's nice.
That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
Brumby!
You must be joking,  Keep him away from the telephone. I'm going out for a bit.
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
It's the truth.
Yes.
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
No. I didn't know that.
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Yeah.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Your brother? What you talking about?
No.
Have another?
That's what he was saying about you.
That's nice. What'd you tell him?
Good lad.
Yeah.
It never is.
My brother, Frank.
Is he staying the night?
No. I'm not tired,  Do you eat breakfast?
Eric. Eric Paice.
Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
Making a living.
You should have told me who you were working for.
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Yeah.
Ask Jack. It's his old stamping ground.
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
And now...
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It's too...
For some sales pro...
Yes, it is.  And you know who's responsible?
Who?
Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
What?
What do you mean?
Somebody...
Should do something to them.
Someone should hurt them.
How?
You're actually talking about this?
What will he pay?
What?
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
You...
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
...I thought that we were only talking...
Why?
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Do you need five grand?
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
Uh-huh.
I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.
At home.
Was I?
Yes.
Why?
Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
Thank you, George.
The leads come in, I'll let...
I don't want to go to lunch.
Go to lunch, George.
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Excuse me, sir...
...did they...
Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
The people downtown said...
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
Moss.
Fuck him.  Fuck Murray.  John?  You know?  You tell him I said so. What does he fucking know?  He's going to have a "sales" contest...you know what our sales contest used to be? 
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
I'm out.
And fifty bucks a lead.
Get 'em to me!
Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it.  I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
No, I don't think so, Shel.
Call up the bank.  I called them.
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
Mmm.
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
Kenilw...
Go ahead.
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.
And when was that check cashed?
The check wasn't cashed?
I just called downtown, and it's on their desk.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
I...
I can't talk to you, you met my wife, I...
Let's...no one's going to know, let's go around the corner and we'll get a drink.
Not to my knowledge, no...
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
What is this, your farewell speech?
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Yes.
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
I know.  How long will you be gone?
I can't.
 What?  You read it in the papers?
How are the kids?
Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
That's what I'm here for.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
And you believed that story.
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
That's not the way we look at it.
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
I took care of it.
Mike, at three and a half...
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him.
You're right.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
I don't think that's necessary.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
Goodbye, Michael.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
We'll go back tonight.  Bring the children.
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business.
So?
He always makes money for his partners.  One by one, our old friends are gone.  Death, natural or not, prison, deported.  Our friend in Miami is the only one left, because he always made money for his partners.
You were unfair with them.
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them?
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
Are we going to eat or what?
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
I'm talking about Italians!
What about Michael Corleone?
That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
It never crossed your mind?
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
You will not hurt him?
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
A homo?
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
It is my job.  I did it when he was happy and it was easy.  It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.  Enough talk.  I must wake up the master.
And your name is --?
Boone.  Clayton Boone.
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
What's to sketch?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
Yes.  You were a Marine.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
But why?
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
But it's just my face you want to draw.
All right already.  I'll take it off.  Kind of warm in here anyway.
Did anyone laugh?
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
What happened?
Better work.
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
I'm game.  Sure.
Nothing would please me more.
Never gave it much thought.
The Great War?
What won't do?
You're crazy.
No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
You'll feel better tomorrow.
I think I'll hang around.
No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Go.
Of course.  This afternoon.
Your father was a schoolmaster?
Head.  Not heart.
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Six years ...
Jesus ...
No, but you dress like an asshole ...
Point-five ...
How ya doing?
I knew you'd say that.
I'm just here about my brother.
I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...
Let them go --
Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
I'll catch you later, Randall --
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
okay ...
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Hell, yeah. Mirror Man here is our electronics expert. He's got some gadgets you old farts maybe never -heard of; Tumbler can drive anything with wheels, and some things without; Toby's a hacker, can do things with a computer, that are pretty amazing ...
It's arright ...
Okay, okay. The important thing to remember, is to Think Slow. Take your time. It may not seem like it, but the night is long. Long enough. Just think slow and think smart...
Dignity...
That's being obscurest ... Who else? Better known. Memphis?
How's Kip?
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
Oh, for God's sake
"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
Sure -
You all right -- ?
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
What do you got ... ?
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
Hey, now -
You?
You hear me?
Nah.
I know. I've missed you, too
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
Hospital.
We can't do that, dude --
For real?
Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
And you got some Italians -- ?
That's what I want ...
I always thought you'd follow me up.
No. Open her ...
Deodorant.
I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good --
I take out my slim-jim...
Let me worry about The Club ...
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
She does have one thing you don't.
What's that?
Tell me...
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
Right. You want to test the voltage drop ... Use the voltmeter ... Remove the primary lead from the ignitioncoil and crank her ... See what you got ... You understand -- ?
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
Wha?  Me?
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
You treated me like shit.
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
They don't feel like you're in construction.
What bag?
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
How much?
What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
Let her carry this shit inside.
Never.
Safe? Here? They'll kill me here. They're all afraid I'm gonna rat them out. People are already looking to walk away from me. I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
What lions? I'm not going near any lions.
We only have to shove'em over the moat.
There are cops all over the place.
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
Done.
Marty, please. Let me talk to him.
They're okay and it's worth it. Ain't it?
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
Did he say what they're asking him about?
Jimmy.  I don't know.  I got so much else on my mind.  I got the kids.  We got no money.
I know. I know. But it'll be okay. Don't worry. I got some money for you. It's down the block.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
I'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey, the fuckin guy loves animals, and this is the last person you'd want this to happen to.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
All right, then.
No, and we got four of 'em.
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
No, I had to talk him down.
I wanted to meet your brothers...
I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
And all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, "I'm sorry." BANG!
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
Shut the fuck up.
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
Somethin's in my room.
It's touching me.
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
--But--
Yes. Under two conditions.
Okay. How?
--That edge!
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Yes.
Good to see you.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
My kind of background?
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
It's on the college.
It's a poker game with this young man. Don't let him see what you've got.
I won't talk first.
Who?
I do.
--Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you.
--And confuse him--
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
Whatever blows your hair back.
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
What does?
Time's up.
I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
You've never been out of Boston.
So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?
Fine.
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
My wife's dead.
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
When did you know she was the one?
I guess.
You're not going to fail me are you?
No.  Have you had any experience with that?
Yes.
I know.
Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
I'll keep in touch.
Only if you grab my ass.
Good luck.
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Is Harvard gettin' all that money?
How was that?
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
What, five?
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
Want me to take a look?
Clearly.
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
Some, a little.
I guess so.
No.
What?
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
What the fuck am I afraid of?!
Yes, I do, Will.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
Don't hold me so tight.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
What'd he look like again?
Why, I guess so.
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
Say, who runs this place?
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
I'll say 'em--an' make it short.  This here ol' man jus' lived a life an' jus' died out of it. I don't know whether he was good or bad, an' it don't matter much. Heard a fella say a poem once, an' he says, "All that lives is holy." But I wouldn't pray for jus' a ol' man that's dead, because he's awright. If I was to pray I'd pray for the folks that's alive an' don't know which way to turn. Grampa here, he ain't got no more trouble like that. He's got his job all cut out for 'im--so cover 'im up and let 'im get to it.
Try an' tell 'em, Tom. They'll get two an' a half, jus' the minute we're gone. An' you know what that is? That's one ton a peaches picked an' carried for a dollar. That way you can't even buy food enough to keep you alive! Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom! Them peaches is *ripe*. Two days out an' they'll pay *all* of us five!
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
Sure do.
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
What you mean?
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
Sure. We aim to.
I'll walk back.
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
She'll be awright.
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son 
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
Go ahead--Bert says take it.
There, them stripy ones.
But who done it?
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Me an' you both.
Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
Now don't you go monk'ing--
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
Don't say that.
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
I want to be an actor.
Then express yourself, Bob.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
Here is now there. There is here.
Not much else.
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
Unbelievable.
As long as I get the laugh.
I was leaving.
That's probably a good idea.
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
I work alone.
No.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
Nope.
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
It was the PLO.
Patch him through....
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
In Detroit. This weekend.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
I'll do it tomorrow.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
Tell them my house exploded.
What's a revival tent?
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
Nature made him then broke the mold.
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Yeah...
Paul?
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
How's that?
Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
That's good.
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine.
Need a lift?
I can handle it!
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
Tom.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
Okay.
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
I'll take care of it.
That's not true.
Why should they?
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Good.
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
If this magazine is so important to you Annie, why are you in Montana?
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
No, let me go.
No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him...  ... Whether or not we were...  ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
When are you coming home?
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
I know. We miss you too.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
You're allergic to hay.
I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare.
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
Oh, I don't know...
We have a business manager. The best around.
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
They fired you?
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Oh, how sweet.
Promise?
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
It's got doors, Diane. Private as can be. Tom?
Frank's touchy about his cousins.  Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
I don't think Warren would go for that.
Because it fits my head. You want to try it on?
I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
Mmm. An editor.
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
I don't know if I can.
There's no hurry. Take you time.
What does that mean?
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
You want to go to a movie tonight?
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
You shut up, stupid!
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
Sometimes.
Alright sir.
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Again?  Yeah sure.
I want it.
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
I'm gonna hit you!
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
Yeah, mom?
Mm-hmm.
Hmmm.
Blow me.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Razor and Blade.
Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.
Pool on the roof must have a leak.
I'm Crash Override.
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Yeah.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Do my ears deceive me?
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
212-555-4240.
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson is working really hard. We got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. I think we've got a hacker.
The rabbit is in the administration system.
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
I'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
Hey, it's me.
Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
I don't want to go to jail for this.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
So?
A patient pickup and transfer to Smith's Grove.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
You do? Okay. Go down aisle A. We've got the best costumes in the whole town.
What's going on?
We're trapped in this house.
Get back!
Brady!
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Four plus Myers.
Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
Jamie, sometimes it's...
It's been eleven months.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
It was the nightmare man
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Oh Rachel!
I've got you come on, go down.
Dad, what's going on?
Fact it Rach, you are desperate.  Your just going to go in and buy a costume for Jamie. Perfectly legit.
I don't know.
Ben-uh-I just heard about the station.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
How do you know?
Apocalypse, end of the world, Armageddon. Its always got a face and a name.
Now you understand?
Sure.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
Yeah.
I'll be here.
He isn't a man.
Sure...
They could be.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
See you.
Why are they under there?
There WAS.
I promise.
I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
What is it, Laurie?
I killed him...
No! Do as I say.
Yes, she is.
What did you use before?
Only minimum security.
Move it!
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
Great.
Look at this.
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
What makes you think we're more interesting?
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Could you--
Ohhhh!
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
No, I don't have time.
No!  No...
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Bye.
Bye.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
He's got like six gold records.
Oh, that's nice.  I'd love to see her wind up settled.  She's a tense one. 
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
I didn't sleep all night.
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
Aren't they great?
Was I?
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
But, you got four children!
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
Yeah.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
It's on the table, Dad.
Mmm, what am I gonna do with you? 
Mmm...
Have I really taught you everything I have to give?  I don't think so.
Based on what?  You never even see him.
What are you going to use for money?!
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
Like what?!  What?
You've outdone yourself.
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
No.
Really?
Like what?
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this.
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
I'd have been a great dope addict.
Yeah.
He's such a loser!
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
Yeah.
Well, I just came from an audition...
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
Oh, so loosely.
Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.
I was so bored!
I recall you.
I'm fine.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
I'm okay.
No, I am.  I am.
Nobody ever said it.
No, I haven't.
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
Oh.  Oh.
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Yeah.
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
What have they got you doing?
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
Yes?
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
I'm not.
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
Have the child taken to bed.
You give me whatever I want...?
Exactly.
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
Let the girl go.
Why?
You seen John Brigham...?
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
What, you're saying she was overwrought.
Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
You know it?
Well, perhaps sometime we...
...how so?
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
Carpal-tunnel syndrome.  From a life of typing.  Commendatore.  <u>History</u>, a hazardous profession.
How could you know?
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
The commissioner is going round the Cafe...
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
Sir, with all due respect....
You were given backup....
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...

Spoken like a Protestant.
Indeed we were.
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
<u>Yes</u>.
I am no going to show you the <u>secret</u> <u>handshake</u>! 
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
What would you guess, Ardelia?
Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
Fine, thank you, but
I don't understand.

Then tell me.
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
...no.
...would you use a small word?
Yes.
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...

"Why?" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit!
Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
I'm not really a--Does it count if...
Uh, yeah, that's...wow.

Ronnie!
Hey, don't run away now.
Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
Shit, Heather. I don't have anything against Martha Dunnstock.
Yeah, and who wants that on their teeth?
Don't worry. David says he's very so he's very.
Heather? Wha...
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Maybe when you hit maturity you'll understand the diff between a Remington University man like David and a Westerburg boy like Ram "Wham-bam- thank-you-maam" Sweeney.
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
You're not funny. Ouch!
It was J.D.'s idea! He made out the signature sheet and everything. Now will you sign it?
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
Yeah, great.
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
You must have had fun.
Sure. Can we make an ice run before the funeral?
Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
Let's kick his ass.
This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
What now?
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
You have to let me go!
Somebody's got to help us!
It's so beautiful!
That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
It's inside a moving car.
I understand, I think. Other women?
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
Did I ever talk about the accident?
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
How much time off?
What's the difference?
And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
Where's my wife?
Okay then. Here's the scoop.
Thanks.
Can you follow them?
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
Uh... sure, Tawny... what?
Really?
One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
It was you!  I thought I heard...
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
Mister LaPlante...
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
I mean, if I said it, wouldja believe me?  Ya wouldn't, would ya?
Bill, I got financial problems and...
Is he here, your friend.  The fireman?
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
You... you think I saved your... life.  I can't take advantage....
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger." Who?
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
Wh-why's he... why's he up there, mom?
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.
And the rent is okay?
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
-- a sense of proportion.
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Because you <u>were</u> pretty?
What happened?
'Who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf, the Big Bad Wolf...'
A man?  Was it a dream?
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
But there's this <u>psycho</u>.  Really. Mom, there's a psycho I have to deal with <u>every day</u>.  I don't know why they let a psycho even go to school!
What?
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
Honey, are you okay?
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
No.
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
His secretary just confirmed.
Oh baby.
He wasn't there.
<u>Everything</u> -- that I've been talking to other people behind his back -- that's what he called me -- a back-stabber and a deceiver. To him and to the company. He called me a traitor in front of everybody and told me if I wanted to be a VP over at Lowenthal I might as well pack up and go -- only <u>Lowenthal never</u> <u>showed up for our lunch</u>!  It's like everybody got an anonymous poison-pen letter or some --  Do you smell smoke?
I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
Just reduced.
Oh, space!  -- You said the right thing.
How large is your brood?
Two -- three if you count the husband.
We must <u>always</u> count the husband. By my count there've been... four. But I still live in hope.
I didn't.
Can we keep him?
No man!  <u>Go to your room</u>.
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
I don't need proof.  I know it.  Send it out.
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
Congratulations.
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
Caution shows wisdom.
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
I learned my fill from Romeriz.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
I hear you.
What else?  What else do you hear right now?
That is what bothers me.
Then it's worth the journey.
As friends -- always as friends.
How long is the voyage?
Me?  Of course.
You.
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Huge.
I remember you.
Because it's my name.
I don't know anymore.
New York is dangerous place.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
--for three hundred years.
Conner?
They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
Why?
It has to be.
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
I'll no forget you.
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
It's about Mars --
You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
That's crazy, Dennis.  The cops will see us.
There is no way out.
Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
They're fine.
I'm here.
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
Give up.
They'll cut the power.
Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!
Have Louise run the name 'Mars Krupchek' through DMV and NCIC.  Tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier.
Give me an ETA.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
You said they would be here!
I still see that boy's eyes.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
Go!  If you get out, maybe you can help the police!
What I want is to help my father.
We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
How about dog shit?
How can we get out?
What are we going to do about Mike?
It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
Go, Chief.
I couldn't find Jane.  She wasn't at the restaurant.
What?
You and I are gonna straighten this out with the Sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  When he gives the word, we move.
How about you and your sister?
If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
They're still in the house.
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Do you think I'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
We, who is we?
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
Where is your family?
Let me explain.
I don't have that much.
Six.
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
I'm sorry, I can't possibly take them Paul. I'm overrun with refugees. As soon as we can stabilize the situation we'll take them.
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
What did you overhear?
Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
The high command? Our high command?
You said you had no whiskey.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
Oh my God!
Just give me a moment to get your keys.
You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
How do you know?
What?
You could have asked for a favor.
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
Jean Baptiste!
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
What!
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
How can we help him.
We have been abandoned.
Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
In Ruhengeri?
I had you transferred to Kigali.
A Volkswagen.
No! Sit down now.
Paul! Then another voice.
What's wrong?
There is one thing I need right away.
That is why they call it coach?
Many times.
Open up the ballroom, we'll put them there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
Many beers.
Thank you, Roger.
No, I don't want you going on the street.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
And what's Steven's status?
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
I'm moved beyond words.
Up here --
And we get this money when?
Prove it.
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
Let's try down here...
Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
All the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there's got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn't just appear out of thin air -- there's got to be pulleys, cables or something, that make them go up and down.
Jesus!
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
Which part of that fantasy turns you on most: me with other men -- or just the other men?
You know everything you do gets me hot.
Question answered.
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
My wife. Where were we?
Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
Fascinated.
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
Excuse me?
He must've unsealed the room!
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
-- I'm coming --
You say you saw some activity here?
It might have been her mother.
There's no need to be.
Sure.
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
Who...is Colleen?
What do you mean?  Mommy? You're scaring me!
He's blessing the house.
For good luck honey.
Must be...
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
Well what power lines, Will?  Where?  Maybe we should call someone about it.
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
I'm being realistic.  Look, I have a spiritual side.  I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house.  That should count for something.
If we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it's troubled.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
You'll have to settle for turkey.
Come back to us honey!
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
What's going to happen?
And what would you do?
Runic?
Not at all, if it can help.
Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
Hell is precisely what is going on, Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I because of a special obligation, you because you're the only person who can help. And because you know what is right, and just, and true.  Will you walk with me a while?
Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
What is it?
What?
Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old.
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
Gum.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
Don't wet your diapers.  I'll have to change them.  "Witchcraft." What's the running time?
"Every day you meet quite a few."
Damn travel agency.  That Kremlin thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
You're a reed, man.  I gotta get Anna.  Hang in there...
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Yes way.
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
Snickers, make the list happen. Oh and it's one thing to play hide and seek with the Mayflower's pathetic staff, but we're sore losers.  I've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty.
Snickers, baby, I love you like a brother, but really, who cares? Silencer bomb...
Yeah.  The big E.
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
Sure Hudson.  Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?
Nice.  But right out of our brochure.
I'll bring my entire repertoire...
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
Actually he never told us what it was.
Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe.  I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. It's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones.  But now finally I got my new goal.  World domination.  With your help...Bunny....quit that!
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
Shucks.  Guess not.
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
The Hudswinger!
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
Well, maybe I --
It's hardly the same --
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
On Norville Barnes!
Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
Please! Norville!
I'm sure I --
Let me look.
What a beautiful thought.
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Never mind about that...
Worked in a watch factory?
Hey! Where's that martini?!
Sez who?
He grins wolfishly.
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
Well, I --
Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
But, Buzz --
It's sittin' in your apron pocket, right where you left it. Imbecile.
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
Yeah?
I --
Not even behind your back?
You're fired.
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
There's one in every story.
He don't look wise.
I do my best.  Every day I dress her just as beautifully as if she was well.  It's just like dressing a great, big doll.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
I'm afraid I'm not able to tell you much. Only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a Mr. Paul Holland with whom we do considerable business.
No, this is quite final.  You see, Mr. Holland is a sugar planter.  He lives in St. Sebastian Island in the West Indies.
The West Indies?
No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother.  You'll like her.
I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
It's my day off.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
Wait. I want to listen.
But she's not dead, Wes.
No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
A figure of St. Sebastian.
Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
Why should you be?  My wife is a mental case.  Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about Zombies.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
No.  It's not just how I felt toward Jessica.  I've been cruel to even you.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
No.  You're quite wrong.  Right here's the seat of the trouble. Mrs. Holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people.  It's revived all their old superstitions -- Zombies -- and that sort of nonsense.
Right o'.
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
Why shouldn't she be?
Hmm. Good night.
I do. I'm -- are you...?
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
I know, I know. I had no idea --
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
-- What advice? You never --
-- 73
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
Darn it, Dave.
And Reverend Edwards? Did you make the list?
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
Yeah. You?
Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from here.
Nobody.
Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
I insist.  Don't touch them.
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
Forget how to ride a bike.
Flame on, asshole.
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Shit. You're not planning --
Major.
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
You going to tell dad?
No!
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
Geometry?
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
I don't know.
You like him? He worships you.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
And?
Are you his girlfriend?
They left it in the jungle.
Okay.
I don't know. How do I know?
Good.
It's only gonna make you crazy.
Don't worry about him...
We already did.
But there wasn't any...
He would have liked that.
What I saw?
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
Has her books in it.
One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.
He's just rattling your cage.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
You don't have to be involved, Will.
What is it?
There's a guy down the hall.  Complaining about the noise.  Says he can't sleep.
You heard me that time.
What kind of stuff?
Told each other everything.  That why your picture's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau?
Who?
She used some stupid code name.
But she was an attractive girl.
Did you have sex with her?
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
If you want it to be...
They did, but too fast for you to see them. No magic, just grace and speed.
But why?
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
Stop her Louis!
Not you my dear.
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
Sit still. It's not finished -
I took your life. He gave you another one.
I can't. Go away from me.
Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -
Be still!
Never.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
I want it!
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I would love her more than the waking world. But there was more to it than that. Perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could. For he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. Life was very different with madame Claudia, as you can imagine...
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
No means yes.
Ray, come on. I want us to be together.
Hey, sorry...  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
That's right. It's how the species survives. You'll never convince me otherwise.  Wanna dance?
It was in a church...it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
To get out of Southport?
I'm okay.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
I wasn't dreaming.
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Yes!
We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too.
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
The rest of us see bathrobes.
Must have missed the sign.
You don't have to be a jerk.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
I'll go find him.
Well ——
Did your servant got word to Dr. Drossos?
Poor Cathy --
How do you know what my father thought - -
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints —— the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
No. I mean your other secret -—	the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Her name is Thea?
This girl -- Thea —- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
Plague? There's no possibility of that, is there?
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
I can't do that. These families have children.
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Oh, no.
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow –– you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
No, of course not.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Zuzu's petals.
Oh, well, I can't . . .
Oh, wonderful!
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
Not a soul.
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child –– simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
Want to give my flower a drink.
Zuzu –– Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
Please don't go away –– please!
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Hmmm?
Yes, sir.
Aw, forget it.
Okay.  What's yours?
Look, Nick. What's wrong?
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Very funny. Very funny.
Did you get a doctor?
Harry . . . Harry . . .
Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
Hello, Vi.
When?
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know.  Well, I've said too much. I . . . You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .
Uh-huh.
Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
Okay –– what can we lose?
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
If I told you it might not come true.
No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
Yeah, just started.
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Hmm? Well, I . . .
You going to the lighthouse?
But of course.
Back down!
No.
I hope that's the cousin.
Yeah.
We're hung up on something.
You're betting what you already got.
Let's just go sailing, okay?
You bet.  Hang on....
Can you get us a line?
Oh, yeah.  Sure.
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
Right.
Please.  It's my job.
Because.
Oh, c'mon.
You heard me.
Yeah?
Well, yeah, I did, that's the funny thing.  You can't tell much from the negatives, I was going to blow 'em up.  Here's a test I did....
Okay, okay -- stand over there....
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
The Shark's mouth.
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
This is a mammal, not a fish.
Probably.
So there's one around here.
Why?
Santos' place.
He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
Sean's asleep.
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Just one minute....
Thank you, thank you.  You know my son, don't you?
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
Did he raise the Kids?
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
No.  Find your brother, okay?
That's you.
Shh.  Shhh....
I want you to meet my cousin.
Great!
3:30.
They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
Next week.
I dunno.  We'll think of something.
And second?
Until we find something.
Is there something I don't know about?
We're fighting wind and current. I though we'd be out longer, catch the incoming tide.
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
No, I'm fine, thanks.
With those camera lights and...
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
You will.  I'll see to it.
Pre-opening jitters.
Okay, bye.
And what else is bothering you?
It's his work.
Not enough loving.
No.
Yes.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
Bracelets.
... Me, too.
Sure.  Let's go.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!
Come on.
So?
Thirty feet???
You wanted to know about a cave?
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
I can have them walk backwards.
I told you, something's upset them.
Three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
Shark bait.  Draws them over for closeups.
We're taking that shark alive!
Why?
Thanks for helping.
How'd it get in here?!
She, Mister Hutton.
He.  She.  Let's blow the bitch up!
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
Not good enough.
'Preciate it.
He's missing.
Well, wait till you see the rest.
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
No, think of something else.
Can hardly wait to do it again.
I am serious.
Now what?
Don't you dare.
Can't help it... ahh...
Ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
I'll remember that, my Lordship.
That's impossible.  If it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? Huh?  Tell me that.  It's like not seeing the Goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
Always do.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
I want to see Kathryn.
Something wrong?
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
Not today.  Come on, Thea....
It's time for tea, Grandma.
Chicken....
Because....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
I don't know...You...I don't know.
It went away....
Where's my mother?
I'm not on vacation....
I like it.  Really....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
Michael!
You have something to say about everything....
I'm hungry, Mom....
Hello?  Thea who?  I know it's Thea Brody.  How many grandchildren do I have?  I know you can use the phone by yourself. You're a big girl.  I know you're five.
You check it....
I didn't.
You're damn right I'm serious....
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
You could teach...You could....
I don't want to talk about that.
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
Promise me....
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
You must get bored easily.
But it gets cold in winter....
You're always taking time off....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
She said it was coming....
Hell, no.  What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas, Matt....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
They won't fight with me....
Where the hell's the beer...?
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
Down here....
So did I....
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
Maybe it's gone....
I'm going down, Jake....
What about the monitor...?  You getting anything on the shark?
'A Moray eel....'
I don't like the song.
Screw you, Jake....
More beautiful with each passing minute...
Happy birthday, darling. ...
What? Whatta you mean, no? Who is -- who is telling you? Whatta you mean, no? Yes, you'll wear pink or else. Or else you'll wear pink.  And, darlin', oh, I'm gonna take you to Coney Island.
The van?
Be my guest. What you got?
The <u>dogs</u>?
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
Thank Christ we got a witness.
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
You don't really believe this?
I'm asking it.
What about Citrine?
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
Are you sure you didn't call?
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
That's a liability, Ross. I don't want you hanging on to my shirt. Anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. I want this bastard living ..
That, I couldn't tell you .. And don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
I don't see that at all ..
Yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
Got a letter from this Goodridge guy? Says, you're upsetting his students?
That's bullshit,
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
I don't know. I guess she must have called him John? I'm mak- ing tea. Would you like some?
Pray?
Why?
No .. not now ..
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
Why?
You find something curious in that?
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
Two or three years ago.
What does that mean?
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
Even better.
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
No, Sir.
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Ugh!
What do I do?  How do I spin this?
Look, I don't want a --
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Wait.  What do you mean?
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
"Something in the way.  Yeah."
And have fun at your bachelor party.
We are?
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
We will be fine!
Oh shit.  You said "boss."
Plus, you could use that commission.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
Oh hell yes.
So I'll see you this weekend.
I think we made a mistake here.
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
We decided to stay with you.
Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
You know I don't do "contracts." But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak.
Yes.
Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
Very much.
Oh my God.
How do I know?
No.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
We still having dinner in L.A.?
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
Jerry --
Let's go the zoo.
Yeah I know.  I did.
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
So do you.
No, Dr. Grant says...
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know that right now more than anything, your Dad would want to know that we're safe. Okay?
You think they could talk to each other?
Which one do you prefer?
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
Mine's new.
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
You'll need an animal behaviorist, someone with unimpeachable credentials.  I believe you already know Sarah Harding.  She's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I bet she'd be dying to prove on a scale like this.  If you convince her to go, it'll be a major coup.  When she publishes, the scientific community must take it seriously.
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
Oh, my God.
I don't know.
I think she's with Sarah!
So that others would know about this place?
Why should they?
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
Funded by whom?
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
We'll kill it with too much, we'll put it into respiratory arrest!  I'm almost done.  Damn it, I need another adhesive, something pliable I can --
Damn!
Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
Well, Nedry said a few systems would go off-line, didn't he?
Fences are failing, all over the park!  A few minor systems, he said!
Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
They smell.
Sattler.
That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
What's that?
Because we're being hunted.  From the bushes straight ahead.
It's anti-nature.
Oh, imperfections?
Please - - chance it.
Hola, bienvenido
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
Relatively.
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
Timmy!  Do as he says!  Timmy!  Do as Dr. Grant says, quick!
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
You learn something new every day. Let's go.
Wrong. Jason can't get a fair trial because of _these_.
I thought she was a killer, too. You know... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors... before she was decapitated.
None of that's true?
Oh?
It's rare... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep.  They diagnosed Jason with simple insomnia... but that's not what it looks like to me. He has every indication of having _insomnolesence_.
Insomnolesence...
How do we prove it?
Not yet.
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
The formality of a trial would be too costly for them.  They're beginning to understand that it's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support.
The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man.  Very good.
In a manner of speaking.
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
I'll commit that to memory.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.
Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
You won't have any trouble finding it.
He was murdered.
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
They're not obliged to tell.
I wouldn't put it past him.
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
No -- not this time.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
You mean you've actually begun some?
"Accident and Compensation" -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her.
What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
These are priceless artifacts! They're ruining the site!
We're leaving.
We need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
That's your monkey, Denham.
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
Sorry. 
Yes -- all right --
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
I go on rounds.
Well, let's go down and ask him.
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Thanks.
When?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
The same as Jane McKenna.
Mm.
Mm.
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
I don't think so.
I believed her, Pete.
Then, close the case.
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
Not unusual.
I think she's trying that.
You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How well?
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
What else do you know?
Does that distress you?
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
Yeah?
Can I be excused?  I'm not hungry.
Uh huh...
C'mon, there's not much difference--
No.  This is fine.  Just take a bite, you'll like it fine.
No.
That's okay, pal.  Go back to sleep.  It's very late.
Oh...
I love you...
It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
Sure.  Lots of times.
Uh huh...
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Sustained.
Yes, your honor.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
No, I did not.
Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
Objection!
While the child was in the care of the witness, he cut his face badly and is now scarred.
My, we are a hot shot aren't we?
A heavy drinker?
Well, I can certainly understand why you left him.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.
I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
I don't.  Jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about.  It's not even close.
Are you firing me, Jim?
I don't want to hear another word against him.  Not another word.  He's a wonderful man ...a wonderful man...
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
Kramer--
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
What if I fight it?
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
Slow down...Slow down...
No.  I don't think so.
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
Any day.
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Yes, Holiness.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
I have.
I have a copy for you.
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
I am afraid.
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
I pooped.
I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
Do I have money?
Ask whatever you will.
What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
In the Americas.
My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this. And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this -- things will change.
The people will not allow it.
It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
Me?
Is that true or pretend?
You cannot.
But, surely, we are safe in Tibet. We don't believe in killing.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
Oh, but you do, Kundun. Who else would be here?
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
I remember, too, actually. I was frightened then. I am frightened now.
You are unharmed?
You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
The <u>reason</u> I lied is if I'd told you the truth, you'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you're doing.
Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
It happens when I land.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
Raincheck.
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
I don't know!
We're ready.
Thank you, Jack.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
I never had sex with you!
As if.  Will you miss me?
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
No.
And Hank.  I know you weren't really trying to hit him.
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
I <u>told</u> you.
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
You flew up here because your boss--
Good luck.
Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  They just want us to sit tight.
Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
Father's a surgeon.  I can even stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a bad idea here.
Ssssh!
Calm down.
Look.
Alright, Jack!
He looks like a giant tea bag.
You wouldn't?
But we do.  Hey, we'll always have Maine.
And this is how he came to the boat?
You talk to the married couple?
Not yet.
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
The somebody else part?
I'm not even a field person.
I never do field work and even if I did, <u>Maine</u>, to look at a tooth of a <u>dinosaur</u> who bit somebody, couldn't you dream up something--
I will... I promise.
Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon as you get back. The gun, too. Be on the next plane, Starling, there's one in 90 minutes.
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Miggs has been murdered.
Why?
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore.
He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it...
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
Yes sir. Thank you, sir...
She died. She went to Florida to retire, like two years ago? She dies own there.
I am, yes.
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
A cattle ranch?
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
Later, listen, I'll -
Yes...! They were screaming.
Promise...?  Then why not take your case file? I won't be needing it anymore.
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
No fair! You lured him with produce.
Your "father"?
Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
Why, I am looking at you, Miss.
When? How?
What?
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
It can be dangerous...
Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
...Fort William Henry.
Dark haired...
Sir!... Might I inquire if General Webb has heard from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them to the fort.
Yes. You may.  You there. What does Munro call you?  The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies to guide you.
Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them. They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range, so when they're close enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. They look to be three hundred yards out.  Bloody murderers.  You have three days.
Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
Fire!!!
Yes.
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his children under the knife so the Grey Hair will see his seed is wiped out forever.
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
Their arms?
Be my guest.
Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship?  Why isn't he out swimming around?
No way...
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
How do you know it was Williams?
There probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
You screw around like that again and--
I can't see them!
He's not at his station.
...I'd really have to show it to you.
Charge set.  Backing off.  C'mon Rover let's get out of here.
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
Do it.
But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
Timex...
Itches like hell.
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
That <u>thing</u> happens to be my friend.
I'm going to kill it!
Probably the plumbing.  You gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
Two hundred meters.
I'm going to try to remove it.
It's had a meal.
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
I ought to smack your face!
I'm not touching you!
Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
It's hit us all hard!
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.
I thought this was a pub.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
No Harry, you can't.
All right, furry muff.
You had better be careful.
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.  If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're mistaken, Kenny.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
But...  Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait until they are well in, then give it to 'em.
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
Plank?
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
At what, exactly?
It's pathetic. You can't be desperately in love when you're 14 years old.
Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
You think I can't learn that?
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled.
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
Charley Wade.
Yeah.
That's not the point.
You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
Come on in--
PDA?
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
I have a B average.
My father.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
We been through this before--
Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
Take that pair over in the corner--
Yeah. I bet he would.
Appreciate it, sir.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
You have somebody else out there?
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
No es la verdad--[That isn't true--]
We have a daughter.
Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish--
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
I haven't been out here for a while.
We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
Bledso
Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
Charley Wade.
Open late.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
How 'bout the Sheriff?
If you spent a little more time training them--
Nobody's too busy.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
He squeezed money out of you?
No. Is he sick?
Yeah?
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Murdered him?
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
Want to take a walk?
Nice-looking kid.
It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.
You don't want to be Sheriff.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
The shooter local?
Uh-huh.
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
You'd do a good job.
I appreciate you telling me.
You suckers haven't had a good day since the Alamo.
But you don't see much competition, do you?
You know who it was?
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
Runnin' numbers without I know about it is both illegal and unhealthy. You remember that.
You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
My life was too weird for her.
Right.
Isn't that French for something?
That's so cool.
I could scoop them out.
It's him... it's him.
Maybe he'll show you.
Be ready.
I think we make our own futures.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
I don't know where you'd start.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
That's my business. Harry.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
What then?
No word from D'Amour?
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
I'm a private detective.  I was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  A guy called Tapert. Insurance fraud.
I heard he was the best.
Oh, I've got plenty.
I'd like to hear them.
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
What for?
I like to know why things happen.
You want more money, is that it?
I won't say anything.
That.
I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
Or murdered, like Nix.
I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
I can't... I can't go any further...
Yes?
Who is she?
Maybe... I... don't...
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
I know, it's stupid.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
I don't remember.
That's ok.
No one ever tells you that...
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
Do you ever see him?
Yes, but no, I can't right now.
I don't want to be.
Well, I mean it more now.
Yes?
Yes?
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
What are you talking about?
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Do you want I send it to your room?
Thank you, Mr. Harris.
What?
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
Sushi.
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
When did they find her?
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
This is the person...you were talking about?
Peter, are you okay?
And how would you describe him?
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
Would you like to rest, Miette?  You must be exhausted.
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
Yes... and you are?
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
You have to say that.
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
We need all the help we can get.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
Alright, Maya.  We'll do it your way.
Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
It's Detective Smythe.
We millionaires yet?
There weren't any voices.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
To that stewardess?
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
That's ridiculous.
The blue.
You sure?
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
Shh.  It's okay.
I don't wanna see that.
Get used to it, babe.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
But?
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
Just one word of advice for next season.
Never let a freshman take your spot.
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
How's that been?
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
Your legs don't look broke.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Big-ass titties?
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
So she's honest.
None of your business.
That what you think?
Whatever, big head.
You do see me standing here, right?
Fine, Quincy.
I can't help girls coming up to me.
I said fine.
Right here.
I wanted you to.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
I...can't.
Nah.  Don't sweat it.
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
Not for Quincy McCall.
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
Better late than never, right?
So you're gonna bitch up?
And what happens when you lose?
You just got back from a four game road trip.
At one in the morning?
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
Yeah.
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
Said he'd be home later.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
You ok?
In my sleep, Burt.
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
Call 911, Mary, do it right now.
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Oh, she's fine.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
baby, please, please --
Yeah, but I don't know --
You just move in here?
About two years ago.
Yeah.
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
-- do you wanna cup?
Yeah.
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
yeah, good, ok.
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
Billingsley's?
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
Great, bye.
So you've done it --
...yeah...
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
ok.
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
What's your name?
Claudia What?
-- can I get you?
Diet Coke.
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
Don't tell me to go away, Stanley. I am the Co-ordinator in this show and you will answer the questions that I ask, you understand?
C'mon, Dad.  We gotta just GET HIS MONEY AND GO, LET'S GO. Let's get the money --
It's ok, boy.
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
I'm a rapper.
Have you ever been to Juvenille Hall?
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
I was listening --
Yeah, I'm here, I'm off the elevator, walking down the hall, now --
I have love.
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
You talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see I used to be smart....I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith. I'm Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the tv --
Brad, dear?
You see?
Stay that way.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
GIMME YOUR FUCKIN' KEYS.
Yeah.
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
I need to sit down.
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
She loves you.
Yeah.
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
There's no asshole like you.
-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
...Lily...?
I'm gonna start rolling --
Like I said, yeah --
Muffy -- coffee?
Are you asking me that?
It's all important --
She does.  From when you were a boy.
He passed away.
Psychology major?
"Frank" was my mother's father.
Yeah. I was trying to get in touch with you.  We got dissconnected.
Is Linda here?
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
Um...soon tonight...I think, yes? Tommorrow...I mean...very soon...very...
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
Uh. huh.
It's interesting.
No one else in here?
No I Said.
I don't know a loud crash.
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
No.
Then what?
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
What happend to you?
I got in trouble at school.
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
Come home soon after the show.
I love you.
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
No.  No.
No, I mean:  I'm telling you this, now. You see?  You see I want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things I've done....that will eat me up....
hey.
No.
How long with Paula?
I don't.
I'm not mad.  I am, but I'm not.  Y'know?
Why, well I think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
But you can't say....
Where will the money go?
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
Tell him I'm sorry, ok, yes, you do that, now, I'm sorry, tell him, for all the things I've done...I fucked up and I'm sorry.... And I'm Gonna Turn Away And Walk Now And Not Look At Him Not See My Man, My Earl, I'll leave now...and tell him it's ok and I'm ok. The whole thing was ok with me -- and I know.
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
818-753-0088.
Mmm.Hmmm.
That's it.
That's pretty cool.
I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
Should be one-thirty.
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
...what...?
That is good.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
He is nothing now.
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
How goes that favor I asked of you?
Come, we have a boat waiting.
I have it all worked out.
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
The King is having a ball, a masquerade ball.  It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one.  At any time Phillippe could be discovered, and what then?  Remember France.  Remember the poor. Remember Raoul.  More wine!!  Where are those serving girls...?
Don't play God with me, Aramis I --
But -- but --
We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
You -- You cannot ask me to betray my king!  I have sworn to him!
Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
We go someplace dangerous.
Who does?
She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
Raoul is everything to me.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
Porthos told me.
D'Artagnan...
Just... water.
Who came?
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
Thank you, your Majesty.
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
Sometimes the poor do grow hungry. But why would they riot about it?
Aramis!  I have been expecting you!  We are satisfied, that will do.
A letter.  May I see?
I did not want to upset you.  It was tragic.  I did everything I could for him.  I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety, far from the fighting.  But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger.
We'll burn in hell.  Both of us.
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
So what is they have enough to shut us down!
we've got kidnapping, grand theft auto, burglary, and two counts of murder on you, and I'm gonna see to it personally that it sticks!
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
Yeah...
What?
Who is it?
Please...
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
Shit, we just started.  But I better log out of this.
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
Bartender said there are motels south of here.
No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot.  That's what you were thinking, isn't it?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
He doesn't have anything to cut with.
Christ!
When do they go to press?
Issue the toilet paper tear as a...
Library of Congress.
You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack.
You look all right now.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
Why?
See? You do know something about him.
I won't be here.
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
What?
No, thanks. I manage very well.  I'll order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 C tomorrow.
I'll get my purse.
I'm fine, Francis.
Francis? Where are you?
No.
I want her! I want her alive...  I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!!
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Do you feel privileged?
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
He only bit women so far, right?
What happened to them?
I call him a monster.
We have it good, don't we?
If I were?
I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
I remember.
I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
Small difference: I'm not dead, yet.
Yeah. That's great. A little time.  I tell you what, buckaroo...  See you around.
Lt. Fisk said...
Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
I figured I'd ask you...
Are you gonna kill him?
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
No.
You like that Colombian stuff, don't you?
I keep getting it for Christmas.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
What disadvantage?
I hope you have a second chance...
I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
"No"?  "No" to which part??
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
"Funny"?  I dunno.  But "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.  Like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
So who's gonna pay for it?
Yeah...
Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. EXT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
What?!?
Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
They're asking for it.
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
"Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking, creaking... Freaking!
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
And you are?
No way.  Not possible.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
You don't, do you?
Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just the messenger.  And right now I'm going to prove it to you.
What are you doing?
Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.
Shit!  Apoc?
Who's coming for me?
That you are a slave, Neo.  Like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind.
This can't be...
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  I say almost funny.
Look again.
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
Yes.
Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them?
I need the main wet-wall.
Not too bright though.
But what?
I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
They're watching you, Neo.
What?
... right as rain.
I'm going in after him.
You can't!
I have to.
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
What?
It wasn't fast enough.
No.
The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...
Follow me.
Thanks.
Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx.  They don't have shit.
Can't we come with you?
How do you know?
Nervous?
You flew before?
I'll say that I'm travelling.
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
I know but let's hear it anyway.
No, she isn't.
Listen...I'm a guest here.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
Come on.
Mind your own business.
My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
What can I say?
OK, get in.
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
You said it.
Fine.
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
Ok, we'll go for lunch.
What is it now?
Don't ask.
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
Watch your language.
The girls like it loud.
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
Yeah, it's your father's.
Well...no.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Yeah, speak for yourself.
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
That you've been to Susan?
He said he would be there with bells on.
Red or white?
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
You mean this, sir?
I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
You're taking this too far, Drew.
I didn't say.
"Death and Taxes"?
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
Well, it's a big day.  Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts?  Last minute refine- ments or variations?
No no, not you.
That's your privilege, Bill.  But given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu- ture, the truth is... joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes.
Sit down, Drew.
As much as Joe's?
What are their feelings?
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
Are you?
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
'It's up to Joe'?
That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
He said that?
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Can't, sistah.
Yes.
Mine, too.
No.  Nothing.
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
I'm lost.
That is not my intention.
Peanut butter.
I haven't.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
I don't have any.
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
Whatever you do.
I don't know.
I am.
It gets worse.
-- Yes?
Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
Not at all.
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
You've got a deal.
That's what everybody says.
What do you mean?
Can you keep a secret?
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
It's all yours.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
Are you going to fire me, Bill?
Um -- not right now.
Goodnight.
'Fish'?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
And I don't give a shit.
Say again?
I'll take it from here --  I am --
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
'...Yes --'
That's me.
What?
I think you know --
'Yes' is the answer to your ques- tion.
I am, this is it.  B Day.
Sure.
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
Hi, honey.
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
You're not listening --
That's all?
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
Aw, you're tough.
You're terrible.
Nothing.
Yer damn right.
Raise away.
It's something.
Joe?
I don't know.
Yes, but --
The fireworks are about to start.
What's the way?
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work.  Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
I would.
No --
I think I know her.
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
That's it?
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
What's it like?
That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
Couple days.
So you're holding my calls?
Seen you together, that's all.
This isn't my room?
When was I in here?
Interested in buying one?
I forget.
Don't say anything else.
You told me.
So you have information for me?
Don't remember.
And what did he say?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
I'll go see him.
I told him about your car.
Calls himself Dodd.
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
Don't protect him.
How?
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
Shut the fuck up!
Why not?
Well, that's me.
Then why are you here?
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
Lenny, is that you?
John Gammell?
Guess I've told you about my condition.
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
Who?
Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory. He destroyed everything; my life and my ability to live.
You're living.
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
Why?
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
Shut it, Teddy.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Prove it.
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. 
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
Maybe. Maybe just.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
Just some guy. Does it even matter who? I stopped asking myself why a long time ago. No reason, no conspiracy; just bad fucking luck. A couple of junkies, too			 * strung out to realize that your wife didn't live alone. When you killed him,			* I've never seen you so happy - I was convinced you'd remember. But it didn't stick, like nothing ever sticks. Like this won't stick.
No. You took them out.						  *
"And" what?
Good.
José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
Tell them what you want.
Deal.
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
Off a little alley with cobblestones.  Hemingway went there...
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
Exactly.
Cost less.  That's the point.
Available cash is not an issue for us...
They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
...it's gonna be an L-shaped ambush.  They're not gonna open up until they got the party favors, 'cause all they'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight. They <u>will</u> wait till they got the goods before they do the deed.
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
I'm also called "Cochi Loco."  That means "Crazy pig."  'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know.  That part of what I do, you never want to find out about.  Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go.  Not me...
"Extras" tried to relieve us of your weight...  And by the by, you know of a player in Overtown who goes by the name of "Things Aquatic"?
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
'Cause she will tell you.
Backup in case the Russians get physical.
Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns. Because when money and guns get together, there is violence...
Like...?
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
If you're down, we're down for the play.
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
What's it say?
"Salutations from the south..."
...you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious, they make mistakes. You're worried about me.  Do not be.  I am careful.  I am cool.  I got Trudy, backup, whatever.  You worry about you.  Because you are the ones who are in denied territory, not me.  If your focus is on me, you'll miss something coming at you.  That's how people slip up. Get hurt.  And I'd die if anything happened.  You worry about <u>you</u>. You and Sonny...are in the dangerous place.  I'm fine...
Meaning...?
I had to lay eyes on you.
Yeah?
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
I show you what problem --
Oh. Guess I got the wrong impression.
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
You like it? Take a look.
Who'd you ever do a favor for? You just let some poor bastard freeze to death, wouldn't you?
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
Don't need a comb.
Keep the goddam blanket on.
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?
You want me to leave?
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
History, man, history. How much?
Twenty months?
Listen!
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
The Hilton.
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Something like that. Cigarette?
Thank you.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Get the... midnight... express.
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
Yeah.
I want to cut his throat.
Oh shit.
You can't take anything seriously.
No!
What is it? . . . Billy?
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
Oh Yesil...  Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil...
Hey. I'm a short guy. Waddaya want?
Take a look.
Right.
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
Look what you did! You stupid sonofa-
Just do it!
Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
Chuy. He was taken. He's down here somewhere...  Oh, please, hurry. I saw what was after her.
Nino, please...
No...
No, there's...
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
What?
What?
I know.  Help me get a sample.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
They're called Novril--they're for your pain. 
Will I be able to walk?
I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
The profanity bothers you?
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
My pleasure.
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
C'mere, I'll show you.
I want my pills NOW!
Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"
The what?
Not even a hint?
Well, it certainly says you.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
It's good you found it.
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
Wasn't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is, do you trust her?
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
Lovely.
What are you talking about?
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
It's that time.  Go.
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
How much longer before you can reach him?
Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
There's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad.
I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
- this is very disconerting..
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Of what?
Damn, you're beautiful.
But it is what you'd like me to do. so tell me to do it..
Something like that.
Then feel better!..
Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
I'll muddle through.
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
Ethan, tell me -
You were there.
What did you think of him?
Then you do think it was Ambrose.
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
Yes.
Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.
Yes, I'm sorry too.. 'You're sorry and I'm sorry..'  - you do know Gradski thought the world of you.
That simple, huh?
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youíve asked the question and you are the answer.
May take a little time.
There was nobody on the bridge.
Take off your coat.
You didn't have to.........
I just need you to be safe.
What about you?
What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply.  I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.
I'm going to try and get some sleep.
Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
Certainly Ethan.
Information.
Now I want you to hold onto it.
Just don't know why I'd be doing it.
Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.
Like Job?
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Just don't chew it.
Give me a break, Pops.
Right, right.  Good.
You wish to meet Max?  This is the price of admission.
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
Why not?
He won't be back in a hurry?
Sure.  If the main character does.
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
You got it.
Jack...that's spying.
Connection denied.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
Rita. Pass the wine.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
Bed.
Again?
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
What are you doing here?
I'm wearing your bracelet.
I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
I know that. I do what I want.
Where'd Johnny find you?
Why you talking to me?
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
I've got you.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
What did you do?
I can't do that!
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
Thank you.
You're making me feel guilty again.
I'm here!
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Hi.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
You have a brother?
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
I must ask for that back.
No.
Why not?
He's with his dying mother!
Oh.
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
I know.
I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
I came right from the airport.
Where is she?
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
Good.
It's nothing!
None of your business.
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
Yes.
It's a house.
What? What?
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
You were a tiger last night.
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
Burn them.
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
Wait.  Wait ... tell me, what also floats on water?
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
Found them?  In Mercea.  The coconut's tropical!
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
All of us are ... we are all Britons.
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
One that looks nice.
And not too expensive.
Now - go!
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
Come on you pansy!
Look!
Stop that.
You're a looney.
Come, Patsy.
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
Ni!
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
You know my name?
A G...g...g...
What?
It is the rabbit.
What?
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
The nose?
Why do you think she is a witch?
I'm not dead!
I feel happy... I feel happy.
What is your quest?
What is your favorite colour?
Blue.
Why?
He hasn't got shit all over him.
Thank you, sir, most kind ...
Really, I feel fine, sir.
Oh ... that's awfully nice.
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
I know ... but ... I want the girl that I marry to  have ... a certain ... special ... something ...
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
No ... just keep him in here.
There's nothing wrong with ... that.
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
Well, let's not jump to conclusions ...
So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
She loved him.
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
I'm getting dressed.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
She means it.
Get out.  Out!
Be careful who sees it.
Louder, girl!
Checked and locked, sir.
Mr Brown, sir --
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
Mama...
And that is my last word on the matter.
That's a tautology lad.  If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood.
How will I know?
Her Highness' Equerry.
That can wait till the weekend.
Occasionally.
It's nothing.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
See what?
They aren't as watchful as you.
Archie.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
Aye, ma'am.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
Are they worth reading?
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Yes, ma'am?
I was told you were in a fight.
Yes.  Yes it was.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
So?
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
Of course.
I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink.
Why was I not told earlier?
No.  I shall be out walking.
We were expecting you to return by six.
Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?!  I am not a fool.  I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert.  And now they attack Brown too.
Why is he not here?
It's a tough game.  Hard to pin that bastard down.  Keeps on changing the rules.
How do you stop The Screamer?
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
Turn if off!
No it didn't.  It's just a faulty relay or something.  It happens.
Laurie's.
It's already out.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
Put in a quarter.
Yes it does.  Don't you see?  We have to play by the rules.  That's what it wants.
Yes I am...
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
We're actually inside, aren't we?
That's what I was hoping you'd say.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
And then keep on driving?
Hold my keys, then.
Sign me up.
What did you say?
Who fired everyone?
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
Whatever.
One.
So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Right. See ya.
I'm Wally Brown. Your Aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it's particularly nice to meet you.
May I have your name please?
I switched apartments with her. She's in #17. Just walk down that way. It's just to the right.
I don't know who I am.
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
Maybe...maybe ... maybe.
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Two men... two guns in the Caddy.
Could be unrelated.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
No one has a gun to your head.
We wait. This is an elevator.
Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
I wanted to let his family know....
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
Bye....
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
What ?
Not yet.
Got it.
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
You did.
That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
Sir ?
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
We can't afford too many surprises.
I can see that but where ?
I meant him.
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
You're Vada right?
This is California, anything is possible.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.
You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
What boy likes you?
Was it a nice funeral?
Have fun.
Hi Dad.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
I will. How's Shelly?
Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up under the Christmas tree.
I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
I was pushing as fast as I could.
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
They sure did! They got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure glad I came all the way out here to find them out.
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
Special effects?
I'll try.
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
More than anything in the world.
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.
See you? He can smell you from there.
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
I guess you have.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
Rose.
It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
Your mother?
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
I'm sure she did. 
Don't wake up Vada.
You think this is easy for me? You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I don't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent if you don't do your job as a kid.
I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
You would.
May I use the phone please.
Just come and get it...right here!
In the tar??
Oh no?!?!?!
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
Really?
Was Rose.
Uh huh, well...good to know. Phil hands Nick a               5 note
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
...so I guess I'll always...teach...you know...'cause it makes a good relief from the operating-room, I feel I have an obligation...
Something wrong?
Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
Oh, sure okay.
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
What do you mean?
I know, look at his little hands.
Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
This guy bonking you?
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in.  I'll let you get back to work.
Okay.
Kinda like men.
Oh, how do you mean?
No, why?
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
I'll second that.
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
You can get the general idea...
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Dad?
I love this guy! 
Why?
Sorry.
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all.  I don't know what's gotten into her today.
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
Yes.
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
I'm very nervous.
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Oh come on.
Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
No he wouldn't, I can't go home.
That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
He likes her.
That's really cool.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
Uh huh.
I'm hemorrhaging.
It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
Uh huh.
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
So?
I wanna live with them too.
Leave then, some friend you are.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
It is not.
Okay.
Would you think of me?
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
I can see why.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
You like her.
Go figure you.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
Which was the disqualifying factor?
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
You win.
No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
Hello.
I just don't want to freak him out.
Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
I need you.
What's next?
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
What, leaving school...
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
Never can tell.
Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!
It's more than that.
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
Get married, apparently.
Well, it happens.
... yeah, that.
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
What is that sup...
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
You have to what?
What?
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
Bye, Bye.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
Everybody likes to be as good as their word.
I said 'no!'
Barbara Jean.
She's in Paris.
Harvard?
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
I'm fine. Can I go up?
Good night,
She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
What did you say?
Need a ride?
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
No.
Do you carry door handles?
What kind?
What year?
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Does their hair fall out?
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
Bye.
It just is.
About three years.
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
Tom. You remember?
Hi.
What?
Oh.
That's unkind.
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
I see.
They said go see the chaplain.
He's pretty well known down here.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
Might be good for you.
Come on.
What? Oh. A film.
You go to school together?
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
Is that good?
You serious?
Yes you are.
What...
Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk.
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
Who is we?
You been followin' the news coverage?
The public loves you Jack...You don't mind if I call you Jack, do you?
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Yours.
Describe Mallory.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Sure.
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
They actually apologized.
Take a wild stab!
The entire wing?
This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
Rockin'!
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
Who?
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Yeah, sure.
I can't do that. Five guys.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
No thanks.
Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
Okay.
You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
Just so you do your work.
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Any other family?
No. I'm new in town.
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
Well, it ain't that good up there neither. Might as well make it here. 'Course I ain't really makin' it now.
Just for the day?
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
No. But a small one.
Yeah?
Come here, baby.
Well, I haven't come around.
What're you going to do?
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
'Round town.
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
Like what?
Yeah, see you in hell.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
No.
I heard you.
Beat it!
Okay.
What did you say, boy?!
I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
That's right.
No, they won't.
All right, son.
Don't you get smart with me, boy.
I understand.
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
Sometimes.  And sometimes I don't--  Shut the fuck up!
Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
Of course...
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
How's the villa's security?
And how do you suggest I do that?
Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
All things possible in Babylon.
I an' I, man. I an' I.
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
You can make your move when it comes after me.
Slow, but good. I got a nice safe blind spot going. C'mon.
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
I'm getting too old for this shit. One oh four and counting.
I don't know. I don't know...
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
What?
Couple of days. They'll examine you.
What the fuck... are you serious?
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
Put the gun down, Case.
Give me five minutes.
So... did you get a look at heaven?
...And if I guess wrong?
You're out of time, man.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Yeah. Let's do that.
College?
Exactly.
– uhh, must have forgotten-
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Yeah.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
Very romantic.
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Just get in the van, Josie.
By Guy?
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
You're a sick puppy, Geller.
Oh. Right.
Have you been to any parties?
He's my teacher!
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
But I'm not a penguin.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
I know.
wasn't even thinking about-
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
Sorry. Forgetful.
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Well, a ball player.
Maybe we should sit.
<i>                      Three of a kind...</i>
I can't help it.
But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
He stayed a long time.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
<i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>
Oh, come on Dad...
You know what I'm talking about.  What did you use, a fire cracker?  A cherry bomb?
Did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away?  And that her mother killed herself in our living room?
He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing his grip - you can get out.
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Naw. Just killing time.
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Who?
Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream who's coming to kill her.  Seems he was a real guy, ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them.
You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
C'mon, cut it out.
About what?
I'm not hungry.
I killed him!  I killed him!
Huh?
We're going to bed.
Please Mom?  I just don't want to be alone.
They're healing up nicely.
He wears a dirty brown hat.  He's horribly burned.  He has razors on his right hand.
No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
A little basic, but nice.
But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
That's not true.  You're the one who's trying to forget.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
Anything?
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
That's what I know.
So do I.
Doesn't matter.
For what?
I've heard crazier things this week.
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
What?
Mary Helena.
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
Where...here?
Night, night, Honey.
Oh, stop showing off.
Films mainly.
Yes.  This one though is... very good.
No.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Yes.
Okay -- fine.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
Oh no no -- no.
Cartwright.
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
With a goat playing a violin.
Big feet -- large shoes.
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Stay forever.
Don't ask.
I don't know what happened.
Excuse me?
Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
Christ, what is going on in there?
Yup.
Is Miss Scott staying here?
Well, thanks, that's great.
The others?
Have you got a moment?
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
So it could have been neither of them?
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
No -- did you?
Buggered?
Really?
She's perfect, perfect.
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
May I help you, sir?
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Well, there you go.  On for a video fest tonight?  I've got some absolute classic.
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
No -- you're right.
Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
What?
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
I-I-I...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Mister McMurphy!
Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
I wanna report a robbery!
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Right!
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
'K-k-kay, Mack!
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
Shhh...
W-W-Where we g-g-going?
P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
Yeah...
Ca-na-da...
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
Whaddaya talkin' about? There's at least twenty guys in there. Let's wake 'em up and get this party on the road.
Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
Atta boy, Cheswick!
Where ya goin', Mac?
Charlie, ya can't ever let those goons outta ya sight! Understand!
So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
Shhh...
Lobotomy!
Lobotomy?
That's between me an' myself. So why don't you boys just shove off. I got some planning to do.
You're fuckin' A-right, I am!
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
I don't trust you!
Scanlon out!
Bye-bye.
Me too! Me too!
No.
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
That's correct, Doc ...
You bet, Doc!
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
You're on!
Yeah!
Ten bucks.
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
To help you relax... please...
P.A. What the hell is that?
I don't have any.
I'm sure you will.
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
He's dead.
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
Sa dov'e' lui?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
Wait.  I have to write this down.
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
Yes?!  To be married, I suppose.
Why are you asking me this?
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
Because.  I know where he is.
Right now?
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
We were hungry.
You aren't?
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Okay.  I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
GET OUT!!
Very funny.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
Tonight?
Any night.
You would?  Really?
Oh, hello.
Mommy, this is Faith.
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
But somebody wrote those songs.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
Yes you did.
I know.  You're right.
No...  I can just tell.
Because you were afraid to fly.
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Does Dwayne know about this?
Live happily ever after.
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
What is it?
Only what?
What's that supposed to mean?...
Nothing.
Sorry.
'Course he does.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
What's she saying?
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it.
What?
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
Packing.
You sure you'll be okay?
My God... you're right.
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
Oh.
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
You miss me?...
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??
Good strategy.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
I'm gonna take her home first.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
Maybe he gave them an argument.
It's a living.
Don't say that!
—ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?
I wish I didn't have to do this, Terry.
"In the church when you need me." Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?
I better see you get there.
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
I want to be a teacher.
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in—
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
The things that go on.
One thing about them though, they're faithful. They get married just like people.
Come on, I know a quiet one, with a special entrance for ladies... .
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
Much more, Terry. Much, much more!
Don't tell me— don't tell me!
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
Well, it's over.
You always said I was a bum. Well—  —not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
Terry...?
A look in his eyes! Hold your hats, brother, here we go again. You think he's one of those cases you're always draggin' in and feelin' sorry for. Like the litter of kittens you had—the only one she wants to keep has six toes and it's cockeyed to boot. Look at him. The bum! And the crush you had on that little Abyssinian... .
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
About Edie?
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
What do you want from me, Father.
This is my business.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
Give me that gun.
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
What about it?
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
Really?
Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P. 
You'll work.
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
So-so, Johnny.
Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this—  —to remember them by.
Now just a minute, I—
Listen, Johnny—
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Nolan, me lad, ye're dreamin' again.
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
You don't think he'd be— helpful?
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
Where?
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
I'm not sure...
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
Maybe so.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
I understand, Master
Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
I can't remember doing anything wrong either.
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
Uh-- sorry.  Wrong number.
Tell me, how do you do that?
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
I know a Glenn.
He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.
Why not?
He called the day he escaped.
Really.  Hm.
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Her phone's probably tapped.
Let's go to Detroit.
Now you're talkin'.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Sure, Daniel.
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
And you let them come up.  You don't try to make the bust yourself.  You understand?
Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
Why you think is today?
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
Yonelle.  Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window.  Fuckin' animals.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
Oh-kay...
That's right.
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
Hey.  You learn from doing.
You're right.  So why take a chance--
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
Of course I am.
You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
I mean, romantically.
Yes.
And your gun.
I just thought maybe you and me could--
Those guys bother you?
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
A girl.
It's not a game.  Something you play.
Well, does it make sense to you?
So do you.
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way.  I'm talkin' about when you're outta here.  I mean, you can't rob banks for ever.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
The fish?
How, Dick?  The way <u>you</u> earned it?  By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her?  What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit?  Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks.  You were a goddamn dumpling.  Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing.  Till you <u>were</u> nothing.  I saved your ass.  So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there."  Okay, Dick?  I can't do it.
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
There were others.
Hejira.
And so now you're off to Glades.
Like what?
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
Oh...
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
You find him, tell him the dog got run over and I'm out of grocery money.
That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's talking on the phone.
He said he stayed here last November.
Your dog was killed?
Something better.  Open it.
It's a --
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
I really gotta go.
I'd like that.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
Like a fag.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
Forget about her.  Tell me where the money's at.
Ten gees.
He was that good?
Red...Strange?
How would I know.
Only when I'm n-n-n-
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Sir?
What lizard?
Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Waitress!  Four beers!
How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
She loves you.  I know that.  And part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me.
I got a half a tank.  You?
I'm out of fuel!
We've always tried to beat each other.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
I d-don't think Japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball.
Colonel...we're all going.  Whether you make it or not.
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
Respect.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
Come on Mom. Give him a break. He's missing the reunion because of you. You know he wants to go.
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
Wouldn't we all.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
Who knows. Remember...  Whatever Walter wants...
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
Maybe I blocked it out.
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
Is this slow enough for you?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
Who?
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
Save it.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Of course.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
I beg your pardon?
Okay.
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
I hate chickens.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
I think they're going to deregulate it.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
Evelyn, take her to her room!
Quiet today?
This morning was good.
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
Don't eat the red ones.
You have an incredible memory.
But accidents can happen.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
Are you doing some kind of science project?
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
Okay. I promise.
What if you're not here tomorrow?
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
Like what?
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
I'll be fine, Dad.
I'm going out, Dad!
He did. We buried him.  There's a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
Sorry about your mom.  I couldn't handle not having my mom around. Just having Gus...
What did?
It's like he's not Gus anymore. He's different. You know, like Zowie...
You'll never find it in the dark.
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
I promise!
CLOSE THE FUCKING LAW BOOK!
I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
More than your friend. Family.
Little baby girl.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
Nine.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
It's me, you dork.
Not bad.
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
What?
Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
Yes.
Yes.
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower.
Were you recently promoted?
Thank you.
Is that a question?
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
Right.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Wyant Wheeler represented us.
That's correct.
... we've got a committee meeting.
What kind of people?
Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.
That's perfectly clear.
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
My lettuce is wilting.
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
Beckett?
Lookit. Lookit!
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
'Mean the whispers?
Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
Audrey?
Riddick? How close?
Think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
Like the light is scalding it.
Hey, who?
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
What?
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
60 years ago.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now let's just go back to the ship.
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
One of the Christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll have to wait.
No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
I would rather we all stay--
And what about the cells?
KEEP GOING OR I WILL!
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
Not afraid of the dark, are you?
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
What do you care?
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
Where did you learn to do this?
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Forget it. Abandon ship.
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
My name is Taylor.
Then you admit --
Except that he's also the Chief Defender of the Faith.
Yes, Sir.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Shit. Get your boots on Martin, next time I catch you putting mosquito repellent on your fuckin' feet I'm gonna courtmartial your nigger ass.
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
...everybody gotta die sometime Red... Get back to your foxhole.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
You lame or something?
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
Where's Elias come from?
I got one...
I suggest you watch your own asses cause Barnes gonna be down on ALL OF 'EM.
Over here!
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
That's a nice way of putting it.
No... I move faster alone. 
I volunteered.
Fuck it, don't mean nothing, no such thing here as a coward, done your best man, next time y'do better.
Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
Sounds like it.
They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
You know what I'm talking about!
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  Seven times!  Seven.
Right...
You don't know.
What's the matter?
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
There wasn't any plane.
No thanks.
Killaine's not that sort of guy. He said no--he meant no.
Absolutely sure.
Why?
No use waiting, then.
They're going to arrest me.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
Do you have to leave the note?
Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
If it has to be--do you mind if I do it myself?  Oh, I don't mean with the gun. This is no trick.  When I wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  It's not so hard for me as you think. I'm not crying about it, I've been skating close to it for quite some time.  The water is cold down there--  But so is everything else.  And there's you.
Beer or ale, Miss?
You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
It is?
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
I probably shall--after I've tortured you a little more.
I've never been to Florida.
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
What does he see?
You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
All right. Get him.
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
For five hundred, what do I get?
You mentioned information.
A thousand.
Quite sure you had no motive?
We do, when we get the chance.
Well--good night.
I never notice the view after the first week.
A couple of hours.
Information.
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
Thank you.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
Go live in a tent.
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
So the shell ought to have gone over?
I've always looked forward to it. All right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
Oh nothing.
Not quiet yet.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
I am a fool.
Not if it clears the air.
Four different people, Inspector. Three men and a women.  I've made slides for two.  They handled both envelopes.
So far.
It won't look pretty good on your record, Killaine.  Where's the girl now?
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
Who's the girl?
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
What does it look like?
Right.
In an hour, Larry.
It's fine, thank you.
Well, we were just...
It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
No jokes.  James is in love.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
Let me see.
Fuck off.
I've known Susan for more than fifteen years.  James, we're old allies.
I'm waiting for your mother.
Why not sit down and wait?
Have you come to talk about me?
All right.
Terrific.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
Promise?
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
But you're not alone.
You never were...
No.
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
There's nobody else here...
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
The shit they pull, huh?
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
NOOO!!
Shrimp and fries.
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
This gonna take long?
Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it.  Hey, Bodhi.
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
What story did you give to Davis?
We've been lookin' for this place for months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We were so close, we couldn't quit. We couldn't sleep through this one. I needed you, Dutch, can't you see that?
That rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles, at most! We're almost home. But the chopper won't wait.
We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
I'll take him.
We figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. After that, there's not much hope. We want a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn't give you much time.
No wonder.  For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  What are your plans while you're in town?
Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. It's finished.  You've won.
You've got a lot of nerve.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
Stolen?
Not exactly.
<u>Ho</u>tel.
So do day jobs.
You know how to drive a stick?
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Mmm, I could tell.
What are assets?
Any good?
You liked the guy, though.
I have work to do.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Was someone rude to you?
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
Did you?
Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
It was a business decision.
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
The young lady staying in your room?
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
No one you know.
Yes...
Vivian's in sales.
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
'Scume me.
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
Of course you will.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
Did you say, "I do"?
And a good thing too.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
True!
Yeah?
-- what? --
Where did you get that?
Do you want me to go on with this?
Yes.
-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
My spy network has heard no such news.
It won't be easy, Sire.
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
No.
Thank you.
I am not left-handed either.
Get used to disappointment.
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
Inconceivable!
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
You've made your decision then7
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
An hour.
What are you saying?
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
Good, what is it?
Well, sir, it seems ...
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
One night.
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
I already have.  Come on.
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy.
This is where we belong, Leo.  On top of the world.  Top of the world!
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
Mrs. Alma Wentworth.  She owns 100% of the profits.
Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
Yes.
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Here I come, ready or not.
Until Thursday, then, Contessa Mio.
Of Siegfried...
Nietzche...
OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come! 
Six months, I'm out on probation, but it's cool now, baby.
What do you do best?
Hey, man, I can't do that here, that's what they put me away for.
Sing a song!  Just sing a song!
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
No trouble. Today's linen day. I change all the beds once a week, whether they've been used or not... dampness. I hate the smell of dampness.  It's such a dank smell.
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
I'm not the police.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
No one met her?
I live there. Alone.
Of course not.
All right!  Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother.  But I'd need a warrant for that, won't I?
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
What?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
But what?  Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
Sure...
Is Mary here?
Huh?
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
Arbogast said...
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Sam.
Of course we will.
This is the old highway.
Watch your tenses.
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  Forty thousand dollars?
What makes you sound so certain?
Sure. It's like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
Why do you ask that?
No. People never run away from anything.  The rain didn't last very long.  You know what I think? I think we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. We scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
To a private island, like you?
No, not like me.
What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
You slept here all night?
There are plenty of motels in this area. You should have... I mean, just to be safe...
No, m'am.
Is anything wrong?
No need to apologize...
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
I didn't think so.
Did I?
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
By the way--did you hear a shot last night?
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
Oh, so you feel that way too . Motions to other room. Stay in there--I'll call you when needed.
I don't agree with you.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
Well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. All of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
Thank you.
At any time. You will always be welcome.
Ralph! Ralph!
It happens that I'm the law.
Great. Consider yourself crippled -- financially. See if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
I wouldn't be trying, beloved. I would hang him! And another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. Eight bodies have been stolen in New York within the last eighteen months. Doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
You don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. I hope they give him the works. Even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
Oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about Judge Ramsey -- a little while ago --
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
Whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
No kiddin'?
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
I don't remember. Not so very far--
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
Here's a wow.
Horsefeathers!
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
Who'd steal her body?
All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
Good night.  And I am very grateful to you.
Fire insurance!
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
You're insane.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
He can't hear you.
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
Like now?
Is Rose here?
I know, Mother.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
Sure. Let me take your suitcase.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
I said I wouldn't.
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas.
Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Yeah, he's still up there.
Well... maybe...
She talks a great deal and smiles a lot. She's very pretty, she has a real good figure. She's very girlish or womanish, if you know what I mean. She wouldn't hurt anybody, this girl. She couldn't.
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
They're discussing it.
I can't see, let me see...
You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.
Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
Of course.
Oh. Did you say something?
Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them.
All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension.
I'm not in the fourth dimension --  -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do.
I'll take him with me downtown.  And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
You're not having lunch?
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
Sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit.  Your real trouble is that you're anti-intellectual. The irony is women are supposed to be emotional, but I never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do.
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing.
Fine.
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Calm down, Rose, let's calm down and discuss it ...
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Do you know what a friend you have got there? Do you know she would fight for you like a tiger, that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you? Is this any way to repay her trust and love? Are you ashamed as I am ashamed?  Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But let me warn you, damn your hide, this is Thermopylae and I am standing here. Do you hear me, damn you. I am standing at Thermopylae and the Persians shall not pass! Now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes, and stop crying!
Got yourself up?
Yeah. I'm goin' out.
Um-hmmuhh. I never drink a whole cup, my nerves can't stand the caffeine. Ehh-hh, Lord awful insomnia in reverse last night. Lay there and sweated blood for hours.
There are more on the other side.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep. Those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house, and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.
No, no, not exactly. It isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. Not at all. It's a... dairy establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful!
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
I'm only trying to help him, Mother.
Exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
What... ?
Abe Lincoln...
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
Lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  It's a tax dodge.
Could be worse.  I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
Yeah.
Entertainers don't count.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
Follow me.
I'm waiting till the time's right.
No.
There'll be other chances.
Not like this.  Are you even listening?
What?
Murderer?  Really?
You know what I mean.
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
I know it is, even if you don't.
Out here.  On your knees.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Leia! Leia's my sister.
I can't see.
Jabba's palace.
Yes, my Master.
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
Are you all right?
Leia!
Lando!
Lower it!
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
Proper?!
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
Your father he is.
Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. I love you.
For you.
Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
We must have a blow-out.
Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Well I want to leave.
Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
Weiss.
A decision had to be made.
Goodbye
No no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
Shell-shocked!
Absolutely.
By accident?
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Ya puttin' me on, right?
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
...Are you going to say anything to him?
What're we going to do?
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
C'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed. If I go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood...
You's the novelty, Champ!
He got lucky.
Get that doctor.
No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Of wa?
Don't like yours neither.
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
Few minutes?
Six!
I'm happenin'! This pig is takin' my shot -- I iz a contender. He's nothin'.
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
You have my food in ya hand.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
Ya sure?
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
Black market?
No -- Just me.
Did you hear what I said?
Hey --
I like yella teeth.
Ya, somethin' like that.
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
...I said that before.
How do you mean?
I'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Ya got heart.
Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker.
Why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan!
Would you keep goin'?
'Bout what?
Ain't had time to check 'em.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
Absolutely...
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Help what?
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
...Tight.
What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
My problem is I got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
So where is it then?
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
What are you complaining about?  Here's your fifty bucks.
Maybe Baby Herman was right.  Somebody wants Acme's property.  Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
Yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  But we'll let Santino handle that.
Earl... it's me, Valiant.
Not much.  It's hard to talk.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Why didn't you tell me?
Maybe.  Why?
There's no time to take it easy!  You don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Yeah, that's better.
Because he's not forty feet tall.  The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
Forget it.
Two bits.
Yeah?
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Have patience!
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
A challenge, on my life.
By my heel, I care not.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
In love?
Of love?
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Young Romeo is it?
I'll not endure him.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
Hold Daughter!
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
What?
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
I take thee at thy word.
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
Well, what was yours?
A most courteous exposition.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
A Plague o' both your houses.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
Is that right?
When this whole thing started you made it clear: you're running the show.  And I don't believe you'd be running this show if you didn't know what was going on.
What is?
You lose them!
Once.
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
I know I don't have to, Sam, it's just that, for once, I want to.  when I was a -  Patriot, it was a given I'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with.  You know: any man who needed setting up.  Sometimes so we might blackmail him, sometimes so he could be killed.  Sometimes so I could kill him myself. IRA isn't exactly an enlightened feminist organization, Sam.  To most of the men I with I was always the girl.  "Send the girl to do it."  "Tell The girl to take care of it."  "Have the girl fuck him."  But I look at you and I get this feeling you take me for what I am: no more, no less.
You're a hired gun, Deirdre -- just like me.
Exactly.  And last night I wanted to be with someone who was just like me.
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
Shut up!
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
You first, Edvard.
Not so fast.  Who's that?
What do you mean?
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
You'll die if you leave here.
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Don't cross me...
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
Of course.  Don't you?
How did you know?
No booze...Pain's in the mind, and the mind I can control.  Alright, let's do it.
Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
Perhaps forged is a better word.  Like steel.  Like a sword.  You're a modern Samurai.  I've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like Vincent. But I've never seen anyone like you.  I'm afraid Vincent will die if he goes with you.
Did he bring that with him?
I got a surprise for you, blondie...
Who's they?
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
No thanks.
What's the difference?
Watch that one, he's an ex-spook for sure, maybe Stasi, maybe KGB.  He's smart, Gregor is.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
See what?
You were smoking?
I've seen a lot of people die before.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
It's a cover, then.  A cover within a cover, a feint within a feint.  You work for the CIA, it's the only possible answer.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
Very ugly.
I never made that claim.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
How could you have done that?
Right now?
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
You sure?
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
You put everything on the line because you...
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
Hey Dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
Cash and Carry, you know, FDR, World War two...
Oh, you would have done great.
I mean -- Earl grabs Booth's arm --
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
Torch it?!
I don't know.
What are you thinking?
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
What are you thinking?
I don't know...
Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
For Christ's sake, Booth, I just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  You got my word on it --I'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
Maybe we can reason with Jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
There it is...now what about the others?
Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
Then we're screwed.
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
It's NOT too late!
Why don't you get to the point.
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
Denning was wearing a bug.
He's irresponsible.
I might have to look into that...
I know.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?
And I'd take it out on him.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
We had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. And there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Damn! MARTIN I'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  I thought maybe it would help. Booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- Earl immediately plays up to Martin, clearly relieved --
Why would someone do that?
Have you known this all along?
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
Sure... DISSOLVE TO EXT HOGAN HOUSE -- NIGHT
Hi.
Shopping here?
Sure.
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
Well I'm here now.
Calm down --
We're gonna talk.
Are you hungry?
Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
Give me the bad news.
So someone did get away.
You think he skipped town?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
Yeah.  We already been there.  This is big, Kenny.  Benjamins.  Secret Service calls 'em superbills.  Banks can't even tell the difference.
The real question is, where are the plates?  If we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
No.
Bathroom.
No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
Carter...you ready to have some fun!?
And you ain't black!
You.
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
What the hell is going on here?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
What?
You said --
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
End of the line.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
Follow me my Asian brother.
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
Some Kung-Pao?
I'm undercover.  I had no choice.  You have to trust me.
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
I'm fine.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Good God, ya'll!
No, fish is a PM food.
It's him.
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
Oh, baby, you cruel...
With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Carter, shut up!
Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
I still have work to do here.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
It happens to be how I feel.
Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar?
Where do you think she's going?
Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
Looking for Maggie.
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do.
You're going to be very disappointed.
Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
Five hundred.
Six-fifty.
Cindy the manicurist.
You afraid to try?
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
Bob will be very happy.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Missed me bad, huh?
Excuse me?
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
Maggie, it's just a joke...
Yeah.
Nope.
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
I don't think so.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
Okay, okay.
What?
-- it was a betrayal.
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
What was what?
Nothing's with me.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
Listen to this, I love this part --
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
I know. 
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
How did it happen?
Destiny takes a hand.
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Magic.
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Where's your mom?
I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
You want me to talk to him?
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
Well.  Things are different. First, you have to be friends. You have to like each other. Then you neck.  This can go on for years.  Then you have tests.  Then you get to do it with a condom.  The good news is, split the check.
Great.  They'll have a parade in your honor.  You'll be Man of the Year in Seattle Magazine.  Tira misu.
You'll find out.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
H and G.  Hi and goodbye.
You think so?
Do you want a fruit plate?
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
I think I know how to have a spice rack.
Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
What was?
Jonah, I'm leaving --
Jonah!
What's wrong with Annie?
When I found you?
No.
Well...
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
I read the same article...
How's it going?
You haven't tried locking them up!
It never ends.
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
Yes. We will light the candles.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
What?
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
Yes.
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
Be still ...
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
Will you be still?
I thought maybe you forgot...
My kids don't have enough to eat!
He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
You mind?

How about in the house?
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
I don't know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing Bob Hope's stool specimen.
Colette ...
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
That's long enough to get out of town.
I can't. I've got a kid.  She lives with my parents.  Quincey knows where they live.
How?
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Never heard of him.
Like you?
He knows where I work.
Find a new job.
Ass first into the world.
They would have killed you too.
I don't want to.
I don't want to leave you.
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
Finland is a country.
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
You don't trust me?
Make me an offer.
Hey, okay.
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
Pull your pants down.
What?!
Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
No one. It was just a test. I need to be sure of who I'm dealing with from time-to-time.
If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.
Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
Tell me what?
Standard vig.  Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
To who?
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Here it comes, poor Tom.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
Respectfully, sir, sending men all the way up to Ramelle to save one private doesn't make a fucking, goddamned bit of sense.  Sir.
The numbers don't make sense, sir. His brothers are dead, that's too bad, but they're out of the equation. Sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away.  One private is simply not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson This one is.  He's worth a lot more than that.  Which is why I'm sending you, you're the best field officer there is.
Forty-two-hundred, I figure.
You take account of the wind?
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
Gives Wade the second shot.
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
White-walls?
A half-track, anything.
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
Thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.
Plenty.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
I changed my mind.
And what about you?
Yup, hell of a mission.
Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
And how do you bluff yourself?
Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
Oh, Captain, they'll always make lingerie, it's one of the three basic needs of man -- food, shelter, silk teddies.  Miller Dream on, private.
Trust me, you're the best.
Sure, Reiben.
Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
Get back to your positions!
More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
Yes, sir.
Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.
We know.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
Understanding the following rights...
This evening is over.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Gee, it's easy.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you.  She's a brain.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Oh yeah!
Goodnight.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
Yes, I...
I'm so ashamed dad.
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Yeah.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
No, I read it on the message.
Yeah, I have to help my father.
Hmmm....
So it's an honor?
No.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
So what's your job this summer?
Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
Yeah?
I think you should wear that.
Won't you see me later?
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Oh.  I was putting the...
Yeah.
Yes.  Are you shaking?
I don't think so.
You're cold.
We decided...
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
You shared it with a dick.
No I didn't.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
What do you want?
Uh... okay... um...
Hello Lloyd.
I'm totally and completely serious.
I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something.  I'm going to give you another chance.  Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening.  Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
I know this part, keep reading.
Just her name.
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
Hey.
What?
Yeah.
Yeah, hey, oh god.  Listen, I wanted to... I don't know you very well, you know, but I wanted to ask you, how did you get Diane Court to go out with you?
I was gonna...
Yeah, alright.
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
What -
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
I pay you too much.
I just told you.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
This is not my problem.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
Wine?
He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
Yes.
Better this month than last?
There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
They're withholding payment.
No, no, what, what is it?
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
Take the neighborhood.
No, he quit - the whole God thing--he has issues. The previews for next week...
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
Cici. Who's this?
Where is everybody?
I'm designated driver. I have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
I'm inquisitive.
Did you do it?
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Good for you.
But you’ll never get away with it.
Enter Cotton Weary.
Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it, I'm into Hallie...
What's your subject?
"And I hope life treats you kind and I hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
Not one bit.
Yeah.
Sid, you don't have to.
You’re not going to get away with this.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
I didn't say she was alone. That guy-- from her home town showed up. They went off together.
I find his work overwrought.
Just for you, Sid.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
Not good.
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Hallie?
Over here.
No, wait here.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
What if your life depended on it?
Stay away from the cop.
Watch your back.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
Is Sid in therapy?
What?
What about rehearsal?
Gotta.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
You're not allowed to ask that.
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
We got free tickets.
But...
Now.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Who is this?
I think you got the wrong number, buddy.
But your voice sounds so familiar.
Thanks.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
Closer than you think.
It may be Maureen Reynolds --
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
And who would that be?
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Did you request this case?
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
Is that a threat?
There's someone here who wants to help.
The killer called her.
And what made you think it was Sidney?
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
GALE BEHIND YOU!
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
When we did the first 'Stab" I realized I'd known Maureen Prescott before, I mean as Rina. I couldn't tell anyone.  Can you imagine the press?
Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
What the hell are you doing?
None.
They're the ones who approved it.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
I'm hanging up right now.
Roman that's not the line.
It is in my script.
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
W-what do you want?
I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
I'll only stay a sec.
I'm going... I'm going.
Hey, hey, it's just me.
I'm so sorry... please understand.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
Who is this?
I want to talk to you for a second.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Guess.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
I told you not to hang up on me.
They'd never make it in time.
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
Go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again.
That all depends on you.
No...
Which is it?
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Answer the question and I will.
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here?
She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
How is everything?
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
Just stay back.
Do you still think he's innocent?
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
LEAVEMEALONE!
No you didn't.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
She's saving herself for you.
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
Do they know who did it?
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Thanks, Tatum.
But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
I bet he's pissed.
Come on. Pathos has it's perks.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
Come on, let's rock.
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
Go start picking up the pieces.  We'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
Really?
It would be too hard.
I read about it in the paper.
What?  What?
Hello.
Why?
You'll see.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
Sit back.
It's close.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?
This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
The sins were used in medieval sermons. There were seven cardinal virtues, and then seven deadly sins, created as a learning tool, because they distract from true worship.
Bullshit.
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
The fingerprints.
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
I'm fine.
Okay... okay... get off.
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
Put the gun down, Somerset!
I don't know why... why now?
Really?
Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. Just ask your husband.
It's a hard place.
When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.
I wish Uncle Ethan was here. Don't you, ma?
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
By what you preach...none!
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
How far's the river from here, Mose?
Came here for a wedding, Ethan... Until that's over, I reckon 'reverend' will do...
Hold on, son...Who's this Colonel Greenhill you're talking about?
Grab hold!...
You were born old...
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
I beg your pardon?
Yes, sir.
Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
No...nor build bonfires...nor beat drums neither. I'll meet you on the far side.
Because she's my...my...
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
We won't be here...Come on!
She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
Ain't worth the mendin'...
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
It isn't fair...
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
Only if I'm dead!
Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
Not so bad, if I could get some peace and quiet around here.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
You have the money?
Never!
Ask him.
What is the chief part?
The title?
Romeo
You're a liar.
Ned is wrong for it.
And yet you tell me you lie with women?
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
Partners!
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
But nothing is happening.
God be praised!  Locked?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
What do you love so much?
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
Master Henslowe, you have your actors.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow…"
Will Shakespeare!
It was the owl--come to bed
Oh--no, no!
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
Then I will go with you.
I know how to fight!
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
But why me?
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
I don't know -- Campbell or something?
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
Can I show you something?
No, not that.
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
I don't know.
No, it doesn't. I tried to let it worry me but it won't. I've worked on that paper for three years. There is a pensioner's terror ordeal on page six every day. Every day. Maybe when I'm a pensioner it'll worry me.
Your friends.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
Except the money.
I don't know anything about it.
No. Why should it?
I see.
And you like it?
Spacious, quiet, bright, well appointed, all that sort of stuff, all that crap.
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
-- I'd be the first topoint that out. In all kindness I would. But, like they say, you know, she's got to want to change, hasn't she?
Hugo.
What sort of car?
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
Unfeasible.
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
It's not for me. It's for love and happiness forever.
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Your painful groin?
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
The perfect couple, I should say.
No.
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Yeah, that's right, that's it.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
That's what it cost, David.
Visitors? Some friends maybe? Someone you talked to?
What?
Here.
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
That one, last week.
You must be Juliet.
I'd be delighted.
And that's not the same thing?
Yes.
Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
Or a fake?
I don't know, I think...
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
What do you expect me to do about it?
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
It turned out to be cancer.
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
What?
-- to be put in that kind of position...
She's a friend of Jill's.
And who's Jill?
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
Uh-uh.
You know what I'm talking about.
Are you in love with her?
Her?
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
Chopped liver?
Why do you wanna know so bad?
Am I what?
No kidding.
No shit.
I am not!
And you need money?
I guess not...
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Great... so how's everything with you?
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
I don't want to... I swear...
I know... you don't know, I know.
Sit down!
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
-- what guy?
You don't do that anymore, do you?
-- ass and legs --
I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
That's it, then I'm leaving.
Yeah?...
Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
-- you know better...
Where?
I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
George, I don't --
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
Great... can we talk later?
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
Yeah, I know. Did you?
Yes, yes, I did.
I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
I see.
Oh yeah?
No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
I said sit down!
I wanna hear about it.
I'm not anti-Establishment.
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
Come on by.
Okay.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
No kidding? Your own shop?
Of course not.
Fine.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
You know what's wrong.
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
George is great but I know what you mean.
-- No. No really.
Well, what is it, honey?
Well, it's George.
-- Yeah, honey...
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
It's been so long I don't how long?
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
... Mmm-hmmm.
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
That's right.
Not with your hairdresser.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
-- just wonderful.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
What was the Donner party?
You mean they ate each other up?
Okay.
Yes, Dad.
I'm not supposed to.
Do they know he tell you things?
Try to think what it was.
Is there something bad here?
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
To my stomach.
Did the appearance of Danny's imaginary friend...?
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
You give your word on that do you, Mr. Torrance?
What time is it?
Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
Fine.  Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
Yes, I did.
Yes.
I just want to go back to my room.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stop swinging the bat.
Stay... stay away!
Get down.
Go away from me.
Wendy...
Well...
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
Boy, I bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
How do you do?
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Jane-
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
What?
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can tell.
What about crack?  You a user?
SING!
You can handle this.
Today was the deadline, Vince.
Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten.
This prom is a real drag.
Oh my! 
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
I love my heddles.  Show me again.
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline.  Hard work.
Wet behind the ears.
Again!
It's after five.  We have to bathe.
Excuse me?
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life.  In order to make a responsible decision.  This is going to be very painful for me.  You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent.  Wait.
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
Give me a C.  A C!
We're nuns!
Sit down.
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
Your cell.  Your room.
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
What's wrong with my life?
I got it.
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the gold.
Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
Saving you.  Move!
You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
Don't push it.
Screw you!
Maybe Hawaii.
Okay -- no limo.
Pray. 
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
Does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
She's counting on it.  She's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. Or a carnival.
You won't even tell us?
What's the problem?
It didn't work, Vince.
That's what I figured, too.
That was exciting!
It's brought people back to the church.
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
Then, name one person who has seen him with their own eyes.
How did you hear this?
Excuse me, Miss...  They have a laugh at your expense.
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered.
I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing.
Excuse me?
What?
When this cut was made, this person was already dead.  This is not Lady Van Tassel.
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
Pardon me?
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
He drowned.  Anyone could see.
There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs...
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
How could he?
Man or woman?
What does it mean?
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
It would be interesting to find out.
Yes, he does.  May I try?
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Won't they still have that justice?  Or, was it a vain promise?
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
It was not butchery.
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
He moves too fast.
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
Doctor, he is awake.
Father saw you die.
He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
She has confessed.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
Give me the big'uns.
About a half a mile I think it is.
I bet you did. I was never bent that way. I'm bent the other way. So, you liked it out there in the world.
We run outta somethin' to drink. Goin' to the county line. You want to race?
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
What?
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
That might be better than this.
What are you doin' with that damn hammer?
No sir.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Sarcastic right?  You know the boys in the band are probably gonna stay over tonight. We'd be glad to have you.
What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
But maybe just for awhile --
Childers.
They told me I was well. They had to turn me loose.
Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.
Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough to scrape by on, I reckon.
She says it's for the times when he's good to her. She's lonely since daddy died. She said sometimes she don't know why.  He threatened to kill her if she ever left him. My daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real good to mama. Vaughan that you met. But he's not able to do anything to Doyle, he's funny you know. Not funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes to go with men instead of women. That makes him not to be able to fight too good. He sure is nice though. He's from St. Louis. People who are queer can get along better in a big town. He got transferred here to work. But mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him. For bein' the way he is. I wish he liked to go with women. I'd rather him be mama's boyfriend than Doyle.
Will you stay here with us for a long time?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
Readin' on this book on how to work carpentry. I aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times. I've always been partial to wood buildin's and cabinets and whatnot. These drawin's they got here don't make no sense to me so far.  You seem like yore tails a'draggin' a might. You got somethin' wrong with ye?
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
I know he does.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
I reckon I don't care nothin' about bein' a free man. I don't know how to go about it.
I never was no good with history.
I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Yes ma'am.
Okay.
All right then.
No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
Naw, I ain't.
I done et just a little bit ago.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
Oh. How about before that?
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
Karl is a guy guy?
Do you smell shit?
Why won't he talk to women?
The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.
We've got some paperwork to take care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry, you won't run into him in the parking lot.
Yes.
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
Better make it charge. 
I confess.
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
Melville, huh?  It's been a while.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
A photographer ...
I've never seen anything like it.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Not a peep.
Uh, better make it one.
She probably died.
Yes, I suppose I do.
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
I almost got married once.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
Definitely. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head.
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
And?
Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
Not a one.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
So what's the time?
Twelve-eleven.  Twelve-twelve.  Twelve-twelve.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
Oh no. Momsie and Popsie have oodles.
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address. 
He's dead?
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
And?
The man has friends. And they're not likely to forgive me if I testify against him.
Thanks. 
You work too hard, you know that?
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
The end.
Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
And started to run.
Good thinking.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
I'm not going to do it.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
Lettuce and tomato?
Yes, please.
Oh, yeh?
You don't.
Why?  If they could never take title.
No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work.  So how would he signal for help?
So you hid the truth.  Deliberately.
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
Objection!
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
The knife.  What knife?
He hit his head.  On the way in.
We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said.
And what do you believe?
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
I'm curious.  The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
What else could it be?
Obviously.
Of course not.  But it was emotional.  A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude.
Bye.
Why?
Because I'm working the night shift - and I got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there's a lull -
He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
What are you giving me with the rabbit?
- Type O.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
Watch it, Daphne!
Now you tore the other one.
But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
That's right.
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
Have I got things to tell you!
What happened?
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts. Come on - you're going to call Osgood.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
I'm just going to get some ice.
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
What's the big idea?
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
Bull fiddle.
Goodbye?
This is where I get off.
Who?
We can have it altered.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
And I can never have children.
Well - nobody's perfect.
What kind of band is this, anyway?
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Rough?
Yeah.
You don't say?
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
What makes you so sure?
Now, really -
Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
Well, I'm not.
For your own amusement?
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
You collect shells?
Please - no names.  Just call me Junior.
If it's at all possible -
I am?
Why?
Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.
I'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - I think he's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve.
You're not?
I know.  Every time!
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
Me?  I'm just a customer here.
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
These are my lawyers - all Harvard men.
Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
You shave with your spats on?
Refresh my memory.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
What for?
Orders from Little Bonaparte.
What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
Exactly! Today’s my day. Tomorrow will be my day. And the day after that? My day.
Pub Golf?
Yeah. Most important day of my life. Whatever. Listen, I chose you to be my Maid of Honor for a lot of reasons: I love you, you’re my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. But the main reason I picked you is because you’ve been so miserable for the past few years, I knew you wouldn’t outshine me.  But here it is, my big day. My big day. And something doesn’t feel right. Maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, I don’t know, but your misery just isn’t working for me anymore.
Still--
Whatever you do, don’t mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
It’s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
Other than, he’s shagging your exgirlfriend?
No, that’s not it.
Oh, hello.
You Yanks and your therapy. It’s great.  It’s all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
When we were together I was “too here,” now I’m not here enough.
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
That’s right. Imagine facing it alone.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
When you’re ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
Yup. That’s why you get to keep your money.
Sure, but it’s never easy. They say they’re okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, they’re not.
Desperation?
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
I haven’t thought about that in years.
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
That's right--
What's his name?
What he talk 'bout?
And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
Yes, mam...
She was dirty and wet...
:...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules -- you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy!
It's cold, Daddy!
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Come here, son...
Now wait justa minute! You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do! I tell you! I say, you goin' to that school, you goin'! You hear me!
My father taught me...
Yes mam...
I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself.
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Good night...
She says I can come live with her while school goin' on, and come back home every time there ain't no school.
It's the heat.
Come in, children.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
He said, I don't know, Ike -- you doin' better'n me, I been tryin' to git in there for 200 years and ain't make it yet!
Maybe soon--
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
Don't worry about that. Now, I want you to say 'Doggy.'
Fragile?
I said -
About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This whole thing has gone too far!
But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.
How the fuck should I know!!
You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY IMPORTANT do you understa-
I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!
Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
Oh.
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
YOU DO?!
Sure, dude.  On the face of every child, on the smile of every baby...
What Cartman?!
Whoops.
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  I don't have a fucking problem!
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.
Young man, you will tell Peincipal Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all these horrible phrases!
I know what it is!
Eric?
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Baba mama!
Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.
I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky Smores are now available in stores everywhere! No biggie!
Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
You bastards!!
It isn't fair!
Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
Totally!
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
You did? Just now?
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
Oh Sara...
Oh, thank you.
So, what brings you out here?  Pleasure cruise?
It certainly is.
They are awaiting further information.
Well you did the right thing Mac.
Look answer my question!
Sounds like you've been talking to Mac too much.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Let's get something straight, Chappy!
Just considering our options... sir.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
You're right.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Yeah?
Words to live by.
I'll do my best.
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Hopefully sooner than later.
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
Thank you.
Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
What are you going to do about it?
Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
Lemme see your ball.
When you get a chance.
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
La da da dalala...
Theo.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
What do you think I can do?
Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
I ain't nobody's father!
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
No...
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
I couldn't care less.
I never saw you.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Theo. Howzitgoin.
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
SHEILA!
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
I like you, Theo. You bowl with soul.
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
Business.
Won't your father help you with that?
Can I ask you something personal?
More than you could afford.
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
Lips still for sale?
You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.
I can't see...
What is it?
Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?
You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something.
Norman, don't do it!
Captain.
Captain.  Right, forgive me.
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
What's wrong with oxygen?
Just worry about yourself.
No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
She should've known better.
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm not gonna be held responsible --
They've left, keep watching!
In a minute, sir.
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
The what?
It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
Maybe we didn't want to come back.
In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the "delay" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
What -- are you threatening me?
What do you mean -- not normal?
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are you --
What could have done this?
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright?
No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.
The refridgerator.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
How fast does it take effect?
Are you?
Is it?
But I have to, Norman.
It's not safe for you to be either.
You think I care?  You think I care if I die?  Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
Top shelf, is it?
Hear what?
How's that?
Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there --
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
Don't be defensive.
Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point.
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
You're clear.  You see the airlock?
Beth left?
Help me lift her.
Shut up and catch.
Gimme a second --
You got her?
No.  I don't.  But I always said to myself, when I die, I want to die laughing.
It would erase all our knowledge of it.  All of our power.
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Meaning?
Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From our future.
"We are friends".
This way, sir.
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
Why's that?
Who's going to pay me then?
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
Not any more!
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
It means you'd better get some rest. We'll be leaving for Mos Eisley first thing in the morning.  The trip will be difficult and dangerous, but it's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to Organa Major.  Now go on!
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
You mean we should go after her!...
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
Yes, sir.
Have you been checked out?
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
Was this trip really necessary?
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
You don't believe in the Force?
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
It appears your ship had an accident. I will see to it that your death is duely reported.  There will be no one to save you this time.
Can you stand?  We've got to get out of here before those Tuskens come back.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
Are you safe?
Something... I've got...you don't.
Oh, yeah ? I don't see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Yeah, well, I hear he's a real nutbuster.
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn't learn from one mistake and I made another, sir.  Sir, my family... my whole family was in Buenos Aires, sir.
What's the hurry ?
Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
I'm getting better.
Don't you have to finish the game ?
Hey, check it.
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
Funny...
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
How do you feel about him now ?
Zander, no...!
Who ?
I thought you were going to help Carl.
Johnny, my Dad's home today.
Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
How do I know if this is love ?
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
Hut... hut !
You're the best.
No thanks, Diz.
You got it.
This time of the year...?
Keep trying, Sergeant.
Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders !
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
Sir, yes, sir !
I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
The Creator has not answered.
KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION!
Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet.
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
Decker....!
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Viewer, standard ahead.
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.
Aye, sir.
That was the order, Mr. Sulu: Clear the bridge.
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
Our... 'insignificance'?
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
You bringing your new friend?
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
The people in New Hampshire.
You haven't heard of it.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
Yes.
Yes...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
It's for your finger.
Later on.
Because I'd met someone else.
I used to go out with a politician.
It used to be the Old Mill.
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
Gosh, you look nice.
You'd do the newspaper right here.
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
What I am <u>saying</u>, is, we have to Look Out For Our Own...Now:  they want to close down Main Street...
Water or mineral deposits.
Go you Huskies...
We had a date.
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
Hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
Look:  Okay.  Okay.  Look:  look you're driving, countryside, so on, you picked her up, she was hitch...
I'm having dinner with W...
I don't eat vegetables.
I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
If there's anything I...
I think he's moved...
Well, I'm going to discuss 'em between you babe, cause it's your idea, and you think you're going to sign to do a, then hold us up in the <u>wilds</u> sweetheart, you are in <u>error</u>...
Will you help me out...?
I...
No, no...Please.
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
...<u>no</u>, they don't...
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
I know...
I can't tell.
She won't stop crying...
Find out when Marty Rossen's arriving, get him a bunch of lilacs to send to the broad.
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
Mmmm.  You have children?
No.  No, but we're planning to.
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
A witness to what...?
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
I can only write on a manual.
I have to tell the truth.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.
...would you excuse me, please...
I don't...
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
Did you bring Bob's weights?
That's what I said.
How are you getting on with these fine people?
Pay her off.
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
And we're glad to have you here...
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
...not at all...
...it is?
So we just got lucky.
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
It takes all kinds.
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.
It happens.
Or blush.  You look pale.
You have to ignore him.
Mom?  What's wrong?
Nothing sweetheart.
Yes.
Thank God for that!
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
Annabelle pick up the phone.
You think this is funny?
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
There you are!
Don't take my picture!
Annabelle put down that camera.
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
There's worse things.
No.
Does Rachel make a lot of money?
Mom...?
Tomorrow?  Can I have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
Thursday's fine...
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
Sure.  I was just doin' my nails.
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
But you're not <u>done</u>!
Because you don't really seem here.
Something's up wi...
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
I need practice.
You WHAT?
Luke.  Can't live like that.
...it's my problem, too.
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
Luke's depo ran late.  I promised I'd take notes.
She's devastated.
I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
And you said...
Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge.
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
And I'm going to win.
Worked.  Like a charm.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
Maybe I was wrong on that one.
You ride with Annabelle...
You'll learn.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
It's no biggie.
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
Does Jackie know this?
Don't ever say that.
He isn't.
And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined.
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
No.
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
But really, you never know.
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
Is everything OK?
I dunno.
Huh?
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
Your story was terrible!
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
Tired of this shit...
Mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. It's a very fine line.
Uh huh.
...gger.
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Again!!
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
So what's going on?
Oh, that's too bad.
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Great. How old are they?
Maybe she has caller ID.
Is it loaded?
Thanks man.
He did?
There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
We don't have time!
I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
What happened?
Even better.
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
Are you going to kill us?
The transmission is an hour old...
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
They were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time--without anyone being the wiser...
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Did you get that, Kulnick?
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
How dare you talk to me in this manner?
That's nonsense, and you know it!
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
One, two...  three, four...  five...  Why you, dirty, stinking...
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
Yes!  Who the hell is this?
Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
Not exactly, sir.  You see, Colonel Puntrich at Air Command HQ received a call from him about twenty minutes ago.  He asked General Ripper if he had issued the Go-code and the attack order, and General Ripper said:  "Sure, the orders came from me.  They're on their way in, and I advise you to get the rest of Air Command in after them. My boys will give you the best kind of start, and you sure as hell won't stop them now."  Then he hung up.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
That's right, sir.
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
We've come a long way since World War II, Major.  And the lessons we've learned are all in Plan-R.
You're damned right they are.
How much soda, sir.
Just a squirt.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
Where, sir?
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
Right.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
General, what's good enough for the President and all the experts he's got working on the thing, is good enough for me.
I presume the planes are armed?
Once the orders have been given, Plan-R requires any new orders to be received on the CRM-114 in the aircraft.  But the CRM-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group.
Then there's no chance for recall?
That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Roger, keep calling them.  Knock off auto-pilot, Ace.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Thirty-five, still straight.
Ready, Major.
Primary arming switch.
No kidding.
In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
Look, King, maybe you've lost too much blood, or something.
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
Nobody's loyalty is beyond question.  Besides, how do we know one of his staff didn't see it?
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
Roger.
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Forget it.
Certainly not, sir.  When they go down into the mine, everyone else will still be alive.  They will have no shocking memories, and the prevailing emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those
In Group?
Yeah.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Yeah!
Yeah, when's he coming?
Hey, you said you did a video?
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Right now?
Do you wanna go to the van?
Yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
That sounds so depressing.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
Huh? No, alright. Well, you know what we need? A hot cop of coffee. Hand on. Ohh, hey, I was up all night too, man. A long, long, long night.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
No.
Erica is in the van back there.
Oh, you were in the band?
Sure I am. It's fun.
Well, that's one way of putting it.
Shit.
Yeah!
Hi.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
No, not really. Middle-class.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Yes.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Oh, wow.
I'd love to read that.
He's drunk.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
That chick, Erica?
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
No, no. That's not the way it is at all. No, I stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. Wait, yeah, no, I was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
Well, what am I supposed to sleep off? My life? You know, I'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when I wake up, what'll I be, Jeff? A pilot? Maybe a Super Bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. Right? I don't think so, man.
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
Will you just put the gun down?
I don't know.
Look, look, just get off my property.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
About what?
Your completely missing the point.
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
I, yeah.
God, you smell like whiskey.
Just go.
Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Yeah, I crash there.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
Of course it does.
Burnfield. No place like it.
I don't know.
Alright, alright, enough with the Boy Scout routine.
You're not serious.
I get final approval. It's in my contract.
If...
So, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
Yeah?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
So where are you?
Hey, Tim.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Why don't you fucking relax? He's having verbal intercourse, Sooze.
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
The fuck not?
Hee-hee-hee, haaaaa-that's it?  Hee-hee hee...
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
He Ikea'd us.
Ammo?
You're kidding.
I know, Hannah.  Look, I'm not going to get an abortion.  I mean, I always planned to get married and have kids - I'm just going a little out of order. Kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself "with child," unmarried, on a long road, with no place to sleep.  'Course, that was a long-long time ago.  But no matter what, she held her head high and said... "Pappa don't preach, I'm in trouble deep.  Pappa don't preach, 'cause I'm keepin' my baby.  Hey.  I'm gonna keep my baby." The great one...
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
My what?
Well, shit-fire, Kansas, that's the sweetest goddamn thing ever...
I want to help.  I'm part of this squad...
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
Let it ride for a while.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
About that luggage.  Where's the phone?
Why, you sweet kid.
Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
With a wildly beating heart.
I was afraid of that.
Well, for heaven's sake!
Check.
Nobody can be that busy.
Constantly.  No, in all serious- ness, it's really good.  It's fun writing again.  I'm happy here, honest I am.
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
Why not?
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
Why not? Don't you love Artie?
Come on in, Betty,
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
What assistant?
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
Why?
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Uh-huh.
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
Fair enough.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
Thank you.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
You can stay here.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
I'll take care of that.
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !

Come here!
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Just follow me.
This is the right day.
I ran into some people I knew.
Where are my cigarettes?
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
Wanted what?
I'm the greatest star of them all.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
You send them.  Is that it, Max?
That's right.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Haven't got a thing.
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
Yes, Madame.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
The Guardians will be angry. They may even send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't really have permission to borrow it. I must go explain to them...
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
He will be. In about five minutes.
Am I? Still?
She didn't take it from you, did she?
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
Maybe it was just an accident.
There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
Later.
When can I see, you again ?
They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Tell me where I can find her.
I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives.
But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
Just like that?
But I don't understand.
How do I fight it?
I don't want your help.
Theories?
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
Throw him out.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
Nonsense.
Cheap but effective.
It's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
Yes. I went there to find the lost Power Source...
You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
Mr. Roebush?
There's no vodka in it.
Brad.
Brad Wilson.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
The kid needs a man to show him --
The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
It sure is.
Too much mayonnaise?
I'm talking about salt.  Oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. That's what picnics are for.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Mom and I do this all the time.
Gus Gorman.
First paycheck?
So where is all them half-centses?
Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
That what they call you?
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Greed!  Let me tell you something---
You catch on fast, old buddy.  Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
Fair's fair.
Anything.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Stone mutha.
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
Join the party, genius! Come on up!
Don't worry. I'm long past saving.
Tell me.
Gus?
He can have mine. Anytime.
Where's the handle?
There is no handle! You just push a button.
Where did it come from?
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Of course, that's what friends are for.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
Oh come on, that's ridic -
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
Everything on it.
Does Lois know about this yet?
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Genius!  --  Lex.
Why didn't you go before we left?
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
I mean they can't even trace that guy on that radar they got, every time they try he just flies off.
Why?
Oh! That black box in our cell?

Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
Where is his home, Lex Luthor? Which way?
Put down Lex Luthor?
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
		DELETE IN CUTTING
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
I'm sorry to see you go.
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
You haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. How could you not call back?
You know him so well.  But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Absolutely!
Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
Superman gets mail here?
Who?
Our other dinner guest.
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
You're just an experiment, freako!
What?
My nephew, Leonard. He worships me.  Let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
Lucky I brought my drums.
I made you, and I can destroy you.
Wait! Not yet! Back!
What do you fear?
Destiny.
Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
I take the man out of Argentina - and it was no picnic finding him y'know? And what does he think about? Bunkers. Still living in the past, when I am about to realize the greatest real estate scheme in the history of the world!
Thank you.
I've been on the job.
I know you're a good boy, Clark. No mother could ask for better. It's just that...
Not really, no.
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
Super...man. Hmmm...
You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
Screaming
Your father was a sick weirdo.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
I read the article.
La de da da...
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
Ready.
I didn't bring any  --
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
And if I don't obey?
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
What's your name, boy?
All of us.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
Then you have on of those 'feelings.' It was called: 'love.'
Twenty-four.
Okay, but...why?  No offense.
Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
How much do you weigh?
What about it?
Where do you hail from?
Well, I was born on a planet your scientists don't know too much about. It's in the Xeno Galaxy. Or it was. It was called Krypton. That's K-R-Y-P...
It is for me.
Couldn't have said it better myself.  Now all this  --  --  west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here  --  --  is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well...  ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point --  --  that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.'  Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know...
I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
Alison Jones.
And what does he do again?
That's okay.
I understand.
No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.
They just finished supper.
Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
Oh.  Right.
But yours is the one who's going to subpoena me, Sam.  Force me to testify in court.  He came by the garage this afternoon.  Gave me this piece of paper.
We've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards.  We've got people pointing fingers, making side deals, and dickering over percentages. Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad.  The rescue squad.  Because they didn't act fast enough.
Your kids never cry.
Good night.
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
And they loved Bear.
Yes.  Like I was putting them into my big basket.  Clearing the hillside of its children.
With our hands.
What do you mean?
Did they give him special care?
What's that, Dolores?
We had a terrible winter last year, didn't we, Sam?
No.  What's this lawyer business?
Was he drinking?  Could you tell?
That's what he said.
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
The people in the town?
Oh.
Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
I won't lie.
Was the bus on time?
Crafts.
Almost three.
Is this it?
Perfect.
Why am I calling you?  You're my father.  I'm not supposed to call you?  What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
What is it?
Poached salmon.
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
Who did they get for that?
Do you have this agreement with you?
No.
In what way?
Yes.
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
Of course.
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
Does it fit?
It's okay.
Oh.  I better get some spackle.
My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
How will he do that?
Great.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
See my mother?
Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
Then what are you doing here?  Go over there and fight!  If Van Cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth!
Give me a chance --
Hurry back.
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
Wait a minute, I haven't handed over punishing privileges to you YET!  Put the whip down and I might respect what you're saying...
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
Why?  Because I don't like the way you toy with human lives? - Your contempt and malice?  Because I won't be the accomplice of your sick ego - and the way it's crippled Susie...?  You think of yourself - you and your column - you see yourself as a national glory...but to me, and thousands of others like me, you and your slimy scandal, your phony patriotics - to me, Mr. Hunsecker, you are a national disgrace!
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Why?
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
I don't believe it.
He means that much to you...?
I read your column every day...
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
You're incapable of the truth...
Susie, there's nothing wrong with Dallas!  Your brother and I arranged it all. And if the Leslie boy is still a squooshy item in your life, forget it! - your brother arranged that one, too!  I don't usually give away presents; but this is my gift to you: Get out of here!  Leave this man!
...And he's got them on him.  I appreciate a thing like that - I appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city.
What about?
No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
And where was his wife?
That's what I'm thinking, Rita. Maybe...
Yeah!
What kind of an act is this?
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
Help me with two minutes of silence!
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
Don't judge a situation where you don't know what's involved...
Begging your pardon, I haven't been down the bowery in years!
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
I can't
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
That is one of my mission parameters.
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
Pain causes it?
No problemo.
Dyson.
Yeah, gotta be!  Miles Dyson!  She's gonna blow him away!
Terminated.
Yes.  Throw it in.
It, John.  Not him.  It.
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
And Skynet fights back.
Why attack Russia?
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
But I promised your mother.
I'm very sorry.
Some.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
That's big of him.
Your manner.
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
What is it with you, David? Where are your feelings? Where's your hatred, your disgust? Where's your fucking outrage, David?
I've had two meetings with him. He's a great musician. Maybe the greatest conductor in the world. His Brahms, Beethoven, Schubert - unequalled.
We're dealing with degenerates here.
I have a duty.
You do shorthand and typing?
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
That is correct.
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
I've had enough of this, I'm leaving.
How?
Who warned you?
What did Goering say?
The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
You know something? You should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity. What do you imagine people thought? The Berlin Philharmonic's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought?
How long's this going to go on, Wilhelm? I say von der Null, you say von der Null, I say von der Null, you say von der Null, we could go on all day. You know who von der Null is, don't you? Edwin von der Nuell, music critic.
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
Yes, that's what happened.
This is absolute nonsense!
I said I have illegitimate children. I don't know how many.
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
I'll tell you, then. The last time this music was played on these air waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself. Listen to it.  They listen. Did they pick little K's recording? Did they pick some other conductor? No, they picked you, and why? Because you represented them so beautifully. When the Devil died, they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march. You were everything to them.
Me? Never.  Never.
That's what I asked.
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
One of my people?
Never heard of him, who is he?
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwängler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
Alright, the beige one.
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
What?
You like it?  It's my first.
Okay.  Talk some more.
That's the way it was told to me.
That's not my mission.
I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
You must have had a fun child-
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
No.  Never.
Ticklish?
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Surrounded by living tissue.
Who is in authority here?
I know.
Remember Daniel Grant?  Do they say, "without Daniel Grant, there is no Baer/Grant Publishing?"  He's gone sailing, Alan.  He's out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are.
"Whereas once I was blind, now I can see."  Night, Nick.  Best of luck.
He's turning blue!
What <u>is</u> your problem?
What are you talking about?
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
How thoughtful.  The gift of inconvenience.
Never mind.
No.
You're the one who started running.
Can we talk?
Where'd you get this?
It was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  You're saying it's not you?
I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
Wha... ?
Not here!  They can see.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
Nicholas...
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Stop talking...
You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
Which grad-school?
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
You shouldn't have.
Fun?
It's a profound life experience.
Call them.  Trust me.
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
You dodged a bullet.
Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
What's all this for?
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
A game?
Physical?
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Have we met?
Ilsa... you're alright?
What's this about?
Look, where is he?!
There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone...
Because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm just driving...
Follow me.
You're joking.
You warm my heart.
Greetings fellow sheep counter.
It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
Greetings.
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Luke.
Yeah.
I, I just can't...
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
This is the last chapter.  Please, please give me clearance.  It's for science.
I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
I got more scared.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
And they're all locked together in here... and he won't let go of them!
Nothing, if you leave right now. There's a war going on all around us.  Don't get in the way, please.
Because it's my phone.  Yes... Mrs. Dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  See you soon.  Thank you.
That?  That's Hill House.
But the experiment was a failure.
Me?  No.  What are you doing here?
I'm with Dr. Marrow's group.  I'm supposed to check in with Mrs. Dudley up at the house.  Is she here?
So far.
That depends.
I have a loft.
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
It's not a compliment.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
We all did.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
There's been some trouble downtown.
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market.
Eduardo.  Rama.
Terry Valentine.
Y'what?
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
What?
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
You goin' back inside?
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
Do you have any friends, man?
What post office?
I was gonna be in that Michael Mann movie, you know -- with Pacino and DeNiro.  Got three callbacks.
Not her brand.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
It's been a while.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
Hey?
Who remembers.
You ever been to London?
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
Poor baby.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
And that is?
You sure?
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Could do, yeah.
I got half.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Yeah.
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
Walked.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
Since when?
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Tell me.
About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
And you should tell Doris...
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
...Uh-huh.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
Is not so hard to understand. Her playing, very polite.
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Then you listen to me, for I am expert. That girl, she give me a headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, I think, maybe, she make a very good typist.
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
I'll have it in a week.
You're out of line, mister.
All right, I guess.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
Congratulations, Gina.
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
I don't know. I don't think so.
Yeah. What do I, uh...
I'm fine. Thanks.
Yeah.
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
Jesus...
Whuddya mean?
What the--
You don't got a headache?
...Nah.
Yeah.
That's very generous.
Uh-huh.
We're just closing, friend.
Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
Sure. Can Ed come too?
They sent us to tell ya.
Doesn't look like it.  We're damned lucky.  This statue is priceless.
He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good shape.  Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  There's no reason to call off the opening now.
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
I don't want to scare people.
Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
So the method of death is the only connection?
Correct.
I think I should come with you.
Oh shit.
Right.  The entire brain appears to have been extracted.  May I see it, please?
How can you say that?  You know it's not true.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
But a virus normally codes for other viruses.  This one's making human and animal proteins.  Listen to this.  "Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4- monoxytocin supressin hormone."
Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
Don't stop now.
That thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.
Read it out loud.
What do you do?
Like this.
They were yellow!
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
Frock's been fired.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
So what?
Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant.  When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
And John?
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
Behind me.  Over there.
All right.  If you're positive.
We need someone to take us to the secure storage area.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
What are you going to do?
Oh God!  Help!
It's coming.  Run.
Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the eye.
I want to book a flight to Fiji.
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
Today.
What have we missed?
What music?
--a dead one at that.
A window onto the human condition?
Certainly a nomination.
Let me demonstrate some examples.
I can't believe he married Meryl on the rebound.
It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
Why not?
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
--I'm not allowed to talk to you.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
You have a boyfriend?  Of course you do.
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
<i>Spare room</i> - I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird.  I'm going, don't you worry about that.
Yeah, what happened?
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
I told you I can't.
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
It's a surprise.
I made macaroni.
What's the hurry?
Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
Well, thank you for your help.
I don't understand.
What do I do.  I'm a key figure in an ongoing government charade. An annoyance to my superiors. A joke among my peers. "Spooky," they call me. Spooky Mulder. Whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. Who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who'll listen that the fix is in. That our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. That the sky is falling and when it hits it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
Penetration but not perforation.
Evidence of what?
Yes.
Yes. I know.
Agent Mulder.
No, they don't.
Incinerate it. Like the others.
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
No. Just fossils, far as I know.
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
You know my work?
I don't either, but it sure sells books.
What killed those men?
And they tell me I'm paranoid.
That would be my guess.
And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
Where are you, Mulder?
I'm in the vending room.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
I was until about an hour ago.
Is that what you'd like me to do?
I'd been told as much.
How was it contracted?
I don't see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. Not even a sewer or a storm drain.
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
All the equipment is brand new.
-- of what exactly?!
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
General McAddie's.
Well, call General McAddie.
Thank you.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
I know.  Agent Scully reported your suspicions to OPR. On the basis of her report, I sent techs over to S.A.C. Michaud's apartment. They picked up PSTN residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in Dallas.
Yes.
About the conspiracy?
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
I want to know where Scully is.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
What about you?
This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie!
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
Lucien Baines?
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
I'd be there for him.
No.
Okay.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
You don't know the procedure.
You're sure of that?
Like hell "wait."
He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him.
Absolutely.  Abigail...
Yep.  Eloped.
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
So you say.
Oh no... No you don't.
I need you to find something in the basement...
You're kidding me.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
No.  Can you get a man close?
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
What else do we do?!
But you looked so cute.  All sleepy...
You might've seen Jimmy Hoffa dancing with Timothy Leary.  I don't care.
Give her some cigarettes.
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
You were in love with him, weren't you?
Oh, yes, yes.
Where is she?
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
Oh...
How did you know I would be here?
He's safe in the Russian zone.
And my passport?
We loved each other, do you mean that?
No.
That's what we want to find out.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
Poor Harry, I wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
I don't...
I can't say that I have.
Ever seen one?
Getting around, Martins.
Oh, pinning things on girls now.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
One can't just leave - please.
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Never heard of him.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
It's good to see you, Holly.
Did the police believe you?
You wouldn't do anything.
I wish I could get rid of this thing.
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Coming to the point, please.
Yes, yes, I remember you.
What does he say?
Suppose I take...
Why no, Mr. Martins.
A friend of mine offered me a job here.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
It's on an island that no one get to.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
The Nazis did everything the führer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality.
She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
Who the fuck are you?
Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz.
The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings.
Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong.
Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference?
I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift.
Is he a Nazi?
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
He's at a home out here.
No.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
Oh, yeah... 
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
You can't curse in front of it either.
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Shit...  Did you talk to your mother today?
I'll go look....
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
Decentralized, nonviolent, increasingly mainstream. We'll see antiabortion, anti-immigration groups form alliances with the gun lobby, Christian identity types, tax resisters and even some libertarians....
A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
And? WHat did you notice?
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
Are all Jews the same?
Explain it so I can.
I don't think you know what you are.
To hear them read Torah.
I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
I don't do that.
Daniel Balint.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
Fine.
We want to talk to you about something....  We're about to launch an aboveground, intellectually serious fascist movement.
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
Shut up...
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
They're not that Jewish.
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
Danny, please. Just give your speech.... And nothing about Jews, okay?
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
No.
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
Johana, am I boring you?
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Congratulations, Enzo.
I won't, I swear.
How do you know that?
Don't.
Dollars.
Great!
They say I'm like Lazarus.  You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
Forget it.  I was joking.
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
... And his friend, Johana...
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
Why?  Are they what's most important?
Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it!  Look here!
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Does anybody live to make a second?
We saw each other a little while ago.
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
... The way she moves.
I got fired.
You sure?
You'll try again tomorrow?
You want to lie down for a while?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
Positive, Sir.
The whale!  How could I forget? Always was something fishy about that woman!
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
Haven't you been listening?
Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
It's Esther.
From the story of Purim.  Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath.
He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
Relax Morty, I think your mom is wonderful. She cares so much about you. Get this, while you were gone she said she'd help me get you to work with the JDL if I'd come eat by you once in awhile. Like I needed any incentive to be with you. She's so...
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
Mazel Tov!
Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist.
I'll be in my office.
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
That's some cold shit.
I drink.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
Go on -—
Rosita —— I have wondered -—
Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
More or less.
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
Tell me.
Then you found the leopard --
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter —whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
I thought they came right past here ——
Don't be soft.
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...
I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The £1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
I don’t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Excuse me?
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
Why don’t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
Why do I feel I needn’t answer that?
I didn’t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier’s being tailed?
Can you tell me how you spell...
Crow what?
Europe...  France. I’m French but I live in London...  ... England.
I wouldn’t mind. Thank you.
That’s right. Where’s the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
No. You’re looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there.  Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit...  Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?
Tomorrow?
Where?
Can I have the reception desk, please.
Should I?
I hope it’s not too significant.
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
Check with your son’s bank. Banks don’t usually give out information about their customers.
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
My rates...
We conclude our transaction.
Anything at all?
Does it matter?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Maybe I don’t.
Could someone have hurt you that bad?
Should I come back in five minutes?
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Should I be?
Can I get up now?
Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
Er... Yes...
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Tu sais où me trouver.
I don’t have your credentials, Nathalie.
I can only tell you what he told us...
Huh. I’m a businessman. What are you, eh?
They lost their son. Why?
Mossad?
It’s a good guess...
Majesty, I can't...
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Well...
Jeanne, no...
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
Tell me...
To marry you.
It would not be the same without you.
Sound the retreat...
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
To avoid killing anyone.
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
Am I... am I dead?
Who are you?
How old are you?
Not unless you hear my confession.
Praying.
You have nothing to regret...
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
You're a fine judge of character, Charles.  It'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake.  But if she's not -- then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head.
For the sake of France, Charles. And for the sake of my grandson.
But... her army's so small now...
I can see her if I want to.  I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
Supposing she's an assassin?
Is it long and hanging down?
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
We're taking back the Tourelles!
Not yet.
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
Me too...
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Because... because you just can't!
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
God knows, but it was a bad idea!
Don't swear...
Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
I need to confess.
I need to confess again.
Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
Only God knows the answer to that.
Jeanne... calm down...!  Calm down, Jeanne!
It's like this... I...we...all of them.
Just over a year.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
Funny time to say this.
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
It costs.
Okay, then I'll tell you something funny. You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja.
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
What did you pay him?
I can look after myself!
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
You'll be deported.
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
Yes, but what good did it do?
So, what's the news?
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
Takes one to know one! Pig!
I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
I've been worried sick.
Out of Warsaw. Where?
A pianist.
In the attic.
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
No sound at all?
.... They met when my mother was an opera singer... in Luxemburg...
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
No, no bible readers.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
No.
Jesus! I'll kill him! I'll kill him. What did she tell him?
A piano?
What will I play?
Naw, it's okay.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
No.
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
You think my play is bad?
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
Aw, I got a brother down in K.C., runs a freight outlet.  I can go halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too exciting, but it's mostly legal.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
Good lad.
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
All right, I'll rent ya everything I got in the warehouse for two grand.  That'll give ya phones, cages, blackboards and ticker gear. You supply the guys to move 'em. If you want a counter and bar, that's another grand.  I don't know where the hell I'm gonna get 'em though.
I can talk, can't I?
You never do, kid.
We'll get by without 'em.
What do ya mean?
Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.
Did he hold you up on anything?
Did he say he wouldn't?
Naw, I'd just blow it.
Get a couple extra guys in the line, then.  We'll give him the shut-out.
Raise 5,000.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
You doin' anything tonight?
He'd like to kill me.
If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.
I feel lucky tonight.
All right, then.
You're a lucky man, all right.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
I'm in.
No.
Oh, Jesus.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
You've got to get your mind off this.
What are you talking about?
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
There!
And I'll give then proof!
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
There. 
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
A new invention?
I know -- I know --
We were looking for this bird.
Oh, that's a phoney.  The men didn't even have to go down.
Let's go and see.  Taxi!
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
This is enough for me.
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
That's my business.
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
What'll I do if something comes up?
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Yes...
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  The police will want his description.  Is this a picture of him?
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
I am on the level. If I knew anything I'd....
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --
How many drinks have you had?
Rye.
She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
That's jolly.
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
I'd like to see you work.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
Someone get a doctor.
You did.
Who's that?
Is that another Christmas present?
Yes.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Your guess is as good as mine.
Sit down!
You talk as if I were Asta.
So am I.
I did find him!
It was his body that was buried there.
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Got a nice evening dress?
Got a nice evening dress?
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
Trying to put it off on her?
Police!
Bonds, sir?
I'm fired.
What's in the other direction?
Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
Damn, this is sweet.  We are going to be home in no time.
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
I'd settle for being alive.  Really. Alive would be fine.
They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
Weird they didn't chase us.
So we wait.
What about the gold?
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
I out rank you, that's why.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
So you can give us away?
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
A car?  You're going to buy a car?
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
...I know.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
Where the hell is it!?
Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
Get up off your ass and dig!
What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
It stays as it is.  We're halfway home now.  Let's not blow it by people getting ideas.
Wes is dead!
Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him.  He was going to kill you.  He was one blink away from it.  He's dead, Epps, and I'm sure as hell not getting my head blow off over his carcass.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
We'll lie.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
If we can find the Hummer, or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay. We've got enough water for that.  But we won't make another day otherwise.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
They must be Saudis.  It's a Saudi checkpoint.  Oh sweet, Jesus.  Come on. Come on!
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
He'll slow down.
They're all good ones.  Satellites we've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam's ass.
You ever think about dying?
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
You know what I'm doing with my half?
Oh, God!
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
Probably would've too if Epps wasn't around to stop you.
We have to do something.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
Yeah, we're down.
You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
Too low.
What's the matter with you?
You know I don't feel well.
A shift change should come through the scheduling office.
Don't go.
Look,dirt!
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
I don't want to lose you.
You don't know.  You don't....
Don't let them separate us.
They're watching us now.
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
Who?  Who's leaving?
Not very encouraging.
What?
I want you for my roommate.
Where's LUH?
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
I don't feel well.
Get out of here, Leave me alone.
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Hang on.
What do you mean?
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
Now wait just a fucking-
Right.
Okay, let's go in.
What's wrong?
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
We've created a monster.
He's my brother...
And what, you'll shoot me? Hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, I'd like to make retirement in one piece.
Look, it's important.
Captain assigned me to assist you.
Sir, I--
Goddamit, Reilly--
Yes, sir.
She's refused to say a word to anyone. What made you think you could get her to talk?
I promised her she'd be safe.
And it had diamonds in the back.
Yes.
In a moment.
Where did you find it?
erect in sweater, arms folded.
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
The type they marry.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Doc--!
I want to see-- 
Um-hum ...
Just a second.
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
But not now.
You say I am a crook.
Monescu.
But you came. And you must forget everything--  except that you are here, Countess.
I would like to.
Disappointed?
No--proud. Very proud!
Thank you.
What time is it?
Monescu!
Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace  and made it into a lamp for my night table?
The six--
What time is your rendezvous?
Now, Lily--
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!
And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.
But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.
What?
The same thing.
And so will M'sieu Giron.
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Good night.
And you're going to fall for them.
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
Giron...!
Yes, Madame Colet?
What is it, madame?
Jacques!
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
Then why did you do it?
The pumps --
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
I felt like black.
You wanted to see the propellers?
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Good. Settled then.
Can I bum a cigarette?
I always win, Jack. One way or another.  Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same.
Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!
Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.  Well come on!
No you won't.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
Is he your boyfriend?
Worse I'm afraid.
If only it were that simple.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
A mistake?
Sssshh. Come here.
This is crazy.
Get in the boat, Rose.
I can't feel my body.
Never let go.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage.
I could stand some more--
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
There's soft music--
Brett is the name.
Married?
Very--your mother?
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
You mean that?
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
Lose?--I won a little--
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
I'll watch for him, sir.
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
Three Jacks.
I wouldn't be surprised--
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
Good!  At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
So what?
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
That's fine.
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
Are you happy?
And you've put it over--haven't you?
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
What's the matter, Mary?
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
What for?
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
About twelve hundred.
It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
You leave the kid alone.
--you'd go with him!
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
Let me look at it.
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
Well I'm not so go home.
Well now that's a little more Like it.
You retired, too?
Here it come: one-two-
I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
How you feelin', Doc?
I imagine it would, yes.  So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
All right, Doc...
Then what do I do?
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
What was that all about?
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
Getting late.  We better get back.
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
Not anymore, not after this.
Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.
Yeah?
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
You're on.
Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-
Jack...
We're gonna do it, boys.  Gonna Get ours.  Feel it in my bones. All we have to do is keep our Eyes on that brass ring.
I can't hardly believe it.  It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt.  We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
You'll never make that stick.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin? 
And I have the entire British economy to worry about.
I can feel your pain.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
So why did you leave?
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Do you have any idea of what any of that means? In English?
...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing:  There's no gold down there.
I thought your specialty was good-bye.
Nothing.
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
Come on. I know better than that -
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
I believe Q's exact words were:  "Hopefully, nothing."
Hey - the world is my office.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
He tied one on.
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
No?
- The family jewels?
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
No. I'm going with you.
My father left me the business.
It's a lousy job, but -  The only reason I stay is for the health benefits.
It seems, 007, we've received a tip
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west.
Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice.
- But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond?
You have to leave -
Fueled and waiting.
Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
Yes.
Junior spends time with his child.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
You used that excuse to get out of the army.
You always got something to say.
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
You were in hell?
He will be alright.
I'm going back home with Harry.
Son, I can take everything you got with that deck. It is marked. Now I'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
Hush.
It would be nice.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
I tell you, I feel like a ghost.
I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra and I thought you need a rest. I'll stand guard. Okra wants to talk to you anyway.
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
Well, you and your husband are special. Ya, Gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
My mother passed on years ago.
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
He is in his pigeon cage.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Pizza Planet?!  Oh, cool!
Okay...
Where was the last place you left him?
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command? WOODY Oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
Sure is a hairy fellah.
I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
Well, then let's climb abroad.
Where is it?  I don't see the --
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
Woody!  The rocket!
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
Everyone, it's Woody!
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Will you quit moving around?!
You are a liar!
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
I can't quite make out -- 
Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?

Right here, Woody!
There's no mirror.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
Is that all?
H'm?
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.
Of course he is.  I've known him for twenty years and he doesn't jaywalk...
Arnie, I need money.  Somebody threatened my children.  They want a first payment of three million dollars.
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
What?
Goodbye Arnie.
We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
Oh, it is?
He's a friend.  He's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation.  He'd definitely had a few beers, but it's not like he wanted to drive.  We didn't know what else to do.  It wasn't my pot.
Will we get invited to the White House?
Cincinnati Country Day.
I'm third in my class.
I get A's.  All A's.
We live our lives by these unspoken rules that are handed to us.
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
She ain't in on it.
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
Depends on the state.
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
The worst thing about you, Monty, is you realize the futility of what you're doing and you do it anyway. I wish you could see how transparent you are.  This food tastes like shit.
You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana. You're helping them.  You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
What's he doing up here?
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
We agree.
I feel like a traitor.
What is it you want me to do?
It's possible.
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
Any way we can do it better?
I have money --
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
Just tell me where she is.
What?
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
What kind of research?
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
You were in my way.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Can you not go yourself.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
I guess you would, Franco.
It's where I live.
Because it's illegal.
Can I see you again?
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
No.
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
So why have you told me about it?
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Do you recall the school motto?
No.
Well, sub us, then, mate. I'm expecting a rent cheque.
Yeah.
But try too hard --
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
Director?
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
Give me the gun.
Say something, Mark, say something --
You're all hear.
It was my fucking television.
So?
Four Grand.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
you'll need one more hit.
In that case --
No joy yet.
That's fair enough.
Well, I've paid for the ticket.
A walk.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
It could. Yes.
Raise shields.
We will be happy to beam down. But first we must have certain assurances.
Bob?
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
No, but you can bet they will.
Understood. Kirk out.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
I'm not trying to break any records. I'm doing this because I enjoy it. Not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
Perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
Yes, Captain.
Goodnight, Doctor.
The same. He's apparently fallen out of favor with the Klingon High Command.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
"c."... "k."
It must be all those marsh melons.
The emergency channel, open.
Welcome aboard, Captain.
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.
"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
For being on to Dillinger.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
Flynn?
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
You wouldn't dare.
So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.
Hah.
Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
Why? What are you going to do?
Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
It grows on you.
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
Yeah.  You know Harry.
Then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  You know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
Okay.  Let's step up the surveillance on her.  Put on two more guys.
Yes.
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick me up at eight.  The de-brief is at ten hundred.
Yep.  Sleep fast.
Yeah, right.
Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
You're not going anywhere.
Sure.  Say that now.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
My husband the hero.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
I needed to feel alive.  I wanted to do something...  outrageous. And... I don't know... it felt good to be needed.  To be trusted.  To be special.
Do you still love your husband?
Louder please.
I think so.
You wouldn't believe me.
It makes you tell the truth?
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
What about Juno?
Looks that way.
God, you have great legs.
Yes.
We must be in the Florida Keys .				* .  .  the Overseas Highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
Get going! 
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
Hold that thought.
Yes.  Go ahead.
Yes.  Now go.
Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
How?
Hello, Alabama.
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
This is great, we got cable.
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
The letter he sent.
Get it.
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
The oriental.
Thanks a lot.
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
What do you want to know?
I don't remember.
Where are you from.
What kinda music do you like?
What would make you think that?
You mean she got a bad batch?
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
I just gotta get somethin'.
What?
You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.
Is this a joke?
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
What?
It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
I don't blame you.
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
She's with me.
No thanks.
You got it.
Get the fuck outta here!
Has he gotten his mail today?
Now tell him goodbye.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
I know.
Tell me.
I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
What's this acting class guy's name?
Elliot what?
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
Yeah?
In case.
In case of what?
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
What are we gonna see?
No problems on both counts.
I guess so. Follow me.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
We grew up together.
I bullshitted him.
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
This guy's gonna kill him.
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.
I'm not wearing a bra.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Exactly room-mates.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
You're still a little... disoriented.
Why not?  Most people have some ID.
Underground.
You're afraid of germs?
July.
No more drugs.  Please...
Something bad.  Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff...
I did him a favor.  Now come on.
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
The gun! ... I lost it
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
A Carpet Cleaning Company?
So we can stick our heads out the window and feel the wind and listen to the music.  So we can appreciate what we have while we have it.  Forgive me, psychiatrists don't cry.
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
I need to make a telephone call.
What...???
Not, "what", babe!  When!
Plan?  What are you talking about?
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
All right, old man.  Christ.
Maybe I do.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Same back at you.
No it won't.  You just don't know shit about statistics.
Put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is.  I'll bet this mornings pay I'm right.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Time.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
You son of a bitch!
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
No charge.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
You listen to me, you fancy city man.  You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it. And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on her.  Now get out of here!  You're stinking up my garage.
Open up!
Kirin?
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Taking a little trip?
I had a fight with Jake.  I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose.  I'm going to take a bus to my sister's.  I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
Wrong number.
How could I?  I was sleeping.
What does it look like?
Jake.  No.  No!
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
That's all right.  I got it.
That a fact?
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
You've been around.
Where you headed?
Lift me down.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
You know what I want.
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
You love him?
Whatever it takes.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Take me with you.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
What are you talking about?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
No.
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
Funny thing.
No, you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so I could go to a hanging alone.
You heard me.  Count it out.
He was going to take the money.
He was going to--
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
You could give me the gun.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
Why don't you come down and get them so I can wring your pretty little neck?
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
Grace, tell him.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Hungry?
I did?
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
The time wasn't right.
No.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
You're not talking sense.
What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
What?
She's dead.
What the hell are you talking about?
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
I know, Mr. Vesci.  I know.  I was on my way to you, it's just . . . what a day I've had.  You're not going to believe what's happened to me. I had the money, I swear I had it. I was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
And John, don't make me come look for you.
No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Nope.  No problems up the road.
Sure, Sheriff.
But, Senor--
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
I'm her husband.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you...  You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.
No!
I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
You came to take my wife from me?
Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
I wanna play a song on the juke.  You got a quarter?
But you was going to fight for me.
Get away from me!
OK. Darrell... Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
Time.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
You believe that?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
No charge.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
Darrell.
Open up!
Soda.  You got any soda?
Soda.  You know.
No! No police.
I'm just going to my car?
That's right on my way.
Do you have to call me that?
May I carry your package, Grace?
Accident.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
You're welcome, Grace.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You love him?
Did you ever?
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Nothing I understand better than a mess.
You don't have any money put away, do you?
I thought you couldn't get your car.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
I don't know about that?
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
He <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
Harlin's.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
I think I burned my gun hand!
You haven't even looked at them once.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
Like you helped her, Jake?
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.
Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time...
Do you remember me getting sick?
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
Two hundred and seventy.
There's no more left?
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
In the passenger car?
No.
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
...And everyone lived happily ever after.
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
Thank God.
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
Three days. Are you hungry?
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
Did you... kill him?
A sign on him?
They got a sign on him in front of Greely's?
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
Same one as shot Charlie Pepper in Lake County?
Well, Uncle Pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if I ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. Meanin' the best. On account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
She's passed on, Kid.
Oh.
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
Lookin' at?
Well... I don't recollect.
Yeah, he's in there.
I'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, I guess.
Well, I guess they got it comin'...  But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.
HEY, KID.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
Easy, Bill, easy.
All that money... I mean... did you...?
What?
Who said that?
N-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
Five. I killed five of 'em.  That counts a Mexican I killed.  He come at me with a knife.
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
There's more.
+ The nose is sharper. Smaller too.                          +  &lt;&lt;And what about the hair? You said something earlier about it.&gt;&gt;
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
They just said they wanted time.
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
A glass of water would be nice.
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
You okay?
Hey, that was your mistake, not mine. Did you ever think to ask me? I've been
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
What'the fuck is that?
Waste of time.
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
Keaton was a piece of shit.
He loved her.
NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
This is totally irrelevant.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Yes.
Very good.
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Say it.
Yes.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
I'm just an M.D.
How is that?
What book is that?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
I'll rule on that presently.   Proceed.
You may step down.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
You would not...?
Yes.
Just now...
Yes.
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
I...
That's not my handwriting.
You've just said you signed it.
Hold on a second.
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
It was good of you to meet...
...I made a reservation at...
Do you know who her doctors were?
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
... that's perfectly all right.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I'm sure you would.
That's perfectly all right.
I had a witness disappear on me.
What?
Are you done?
This is Miss Costello...?
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
Missus...
What Hotel are you staying at?
I'm a lawyer.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Yes.  It was, actually.
I think I will.
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
What happened...?
No, no, I'm just...
Yes.
You're talking like a drunk.
I have to talk to you.
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
I'm going to help her.
That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it.  We let them buy the case.  That's what I took it for.  You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
Oh shit, what's today?
Today is Tuesday.  What?
Mickey:  I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
I can't talk now.
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Read me what she said.
The 'History'...?
The Hospital...?
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
... fifty thousand dollars?
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
Hi.  How are you doing?
You live in the neighborhood?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes, that's correct.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Yes, the roving nurse...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Why did it take that long to get her heartbeat...
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
I want you.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
Nothing.
And when she goes to those places...
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
Let me come in.
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Tomorrow morning.
No.
But Scottie, you don't have to!
Judy --
To complete my cure.
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
But why? Why here?
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
No!
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
Took no chances, did he?  And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
Your accident...
This afternoon.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
No!
Only this far.
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
Yes.
Please let me go.
Please answer my question.
Does she sleep here? Ever?
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
I know. Everybody tells me.
Ah, Johnny-O...
Normal.
How?
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Do you know him well?
Yeah.
Oh... this and that.
But you said grey, sir.
Well...
What are you doing?
I'm calling the ambulance.
Calling the ambulance.
Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
Just giving the facts.
She's got bondage burns on her wrists. There's blow all over the room, Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion. This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month. Micheal goes down, we all go down.
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
It has worked.
They're screaming like monsters and it's giving me a headache. Go get some fucking Starbursts.
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
What happened? Oh my God...
There's more.
What does that mean?
That's right.
Not tonight.
No.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
He's having a problem here.
What did you ask me?
Say it again.
I just want to get married.
Yeah.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
Fine? Fine what?
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
Oh really? Starbucks?
You hate women.
True.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
How about my Fatburger?
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
I love you.
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
Are we supposed to?
Why can't we do it through the mail?
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
I wouldn't know.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
He's a moron.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
I just don't see him in the big picture.
You expect more what?
I've seen it on television.
Of course.
I'm not. What's the problem?
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Maybe.
I will.
Hi.
Where are you?
How late?
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Are they fighting?
No one's discussing it. I'm just gonna run Micheal home. I'll be right back.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
What kind of stupid question is that?
The prostitute.
The only proof is those bodies.
Move the bodies?
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
But...
Come on.
The wahoo?
Well if you do think about names... Micheal's a pretty good one...It's done me all right.
I got to agree with that.
Did she believe you?
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
"You Send Me."
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
What's that?
What about them?
They're playing games behind the couch ...
That one.
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
No.
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
You see, even the voice.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
Wasn't that cowardice?
No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed.
Just say the word, sir, and I'll do anything.
She won't even know.
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
And in the vegetable plot?
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
Thank you; but it's missing something.
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
Leave him alone.
How much do you want for him?
Don't say that.
The retreat will start soon. You can leave tomorrow morning.
Mother.
A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
Good, then let's go!
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
Have I slept long?
Hello.
Today, a good girl.
Whatever.
Name was Clyde Reilly. Hardware specialist.  LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the building.
Then I guess we're even.
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
Not from in here.
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
What I need is a nymphomaniac.
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
Help me get out of here.
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
What you need is a collar.
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
You've studied me, now I'm studying you. Seems only fair, don't you think?
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
Stop me.
I'm doing the best I can!
You like baseball?
Authority still makes me nervous.
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
Why's that?
What are you talking about?
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
What can it hurt is they offend me.
Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...?
...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
...and...
No, no, no...
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
It's going to be fine.  It's going to be ... you remember in 88, when...
Lookit, don't worry about it.  It's not a New Concept. Wake me when we touch down, will...
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
Yes
...that's the general idea.
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
...take a long view.
A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...
<u>So</u> forth...
Waal, I gotta tell you.  I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
How's your wife?
Well, he doesn't have his Green Card.  He Doesn't have his Greencard.
Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...
Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.  There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us in something of a pickle?  Albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  There is no War.
...we own it?
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
I'll play your silly game.
Dartmouth
...holding action.  THEY'RE GOING TO TEAR THIS GUY TO <u>Shreds</u>.
...going to War...
I never won an Oscar.
You know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  You're a <u>director</u>...  But if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  What did you do?  All you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  Some plaque on the wall...
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
Because.
Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
Lots n lotsa cash.  Stay on for Gracie, she'll get you a ticket 
Where is he now?
Oh, you're gonna love this:
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
Uh huh...why?
Ha ha.  No, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, But Someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story...
You got a dime....?
Get on the phone, have'em fly in a ...whaddaya need to be a citizen?  A Judge?  Whaddaya need?  A Judge...? Call in a <u>Judge</u>, call in a Federal <u>Judge</u>, and...  If you're concerned about him, being an ..."immigrant." Make him a <u>citizen</u>... Eh?  <u>Guys</u> ... what's all this <u>mopery</u>, we...
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
Watch me.
British Regiments drape their drums in Leopard Skins.
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
I believe in you....
Surest thing you know.
Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the <u>ghettos</u>...  Come on, Pal...
Show some compassion.
Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
a "pond," or
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
...gotta read my reports.
It's called pasta now Dad, spaghetti's out of date.
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
You sure?
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
So you're hot on this stock?
What was that?
Yeah, right...
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when I left the office. It might spin up to 25 by the bell...
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
You sandbagged me on Bluestar.  I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
Yeah, almost...
You're not trouble by any chance. Are you?
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
Old values. Buy.
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
I can't...and I won't.
Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared little girl all wrapped in a pretty grown-up package. Does this mean you're ready to cut the umbilical cord and step out into the world on your own? Because, Darien, if you're through with me, you're through with everything I'm a part of.
You got it, G.G.
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Ok toots, I will.
Allow me sir
No Jonathan.
They seemed, closing by much 
That's not what you said last night.
China
I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.
It's only two hours away.
Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
What?
You're joking.
No.
Almost.
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
At the party.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Um...
When...when will she be back?
Oh-kay...
I'm not...
Please leave me alone.
Oh God...
Stop.
Do we have to?
Jody--
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
What?
Why?
Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
What is it?
Jody he was lying.
Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
That's not what I'm sug--
Nothing's going to happen.  Besides, I have to work tonight.  The conference is in less than two weeks. I've got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  This is...
Did you call the police?
You are so brilliant.
That's...
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
Did you tell her?
A flare?
Claire, listen to me.  I know you're under some strain.  But there's no such thing as ghosts.  They don't exist.  Our neighbor did not kill his wife, and I...wait, why aren't you dressed?
Sabotage?
What's wrong with me?
The...
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
Of course she did, Norman.  What else could it be?
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Huh.
MADISON!
:Well, they are.
Then what is he...?
You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
Two heartbeats.
You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
When did she die...?
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
ENOUGH!!!
The door, Michael.  find the key...
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
Explain this to me --- violated...?
If you knew how I yearn for that...
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. and Deborah.  Stella - Marguerite - Antha  - Diedre -  All of them.  And you will have a child...
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
Really...?  Your family there...?
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
Mad. for each other.
I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
That's not funny.
Lock the door.  Lock it
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
Go ahead.
Gotcha.
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.
A person could get killed round here just for working late
Don't mention it - now can I get back to my accounts, or do you want to fillet me?
Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round.
I really don't know what to say
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
I don't know
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
I don't know...
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
Surgery? Are you a doctor?
Yes - one please.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
It's a lot to digest. Imagine how you'd feel.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
From your lips, to God's ears.
Yeah?
If you don't have...I mean...
Yeah? You like?
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
You have changed since second grade.
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
You're way ahead of me again?
I guess.
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
...not the pit.
It's okay. You need me?
Why don't you just admit what this is really all about? I'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.
I will not have my boys arguing.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
So, what brings you here at his hour?
You want it in writing?
Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
Funny you should say "peachy."
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
I see.
It's all so complicated.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
I'm trembling with excitement.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
That's refreshingly deviant.
Which explains the continued success of "Heaven" for how many decades?
You're quick. I like that.
Only the best for my mother.
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
Really? You'd do that for me?
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this "stuff" spoil you.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
Kelly Van Ryan...
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
I'd like that.
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
Then I guess Walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  He don't use it for no good deeds anyway.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
Take your time.
That's okay, Kelly.  You're doing fine.  But I have to ask you something here. When you say it hurt.  Was this the first time a man was inside you?
I'd like that.
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
I net a guy in a bar.
Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
I guess.
What was that?
Yeah... okay... he did
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
Okay.  I want you to hear this too. We've got to be cool.  All of us. People think I'm rich, for Christ's sake.   I'm doing what rich guys do.  I'm spending my money.  It's more suspicious if I sit around doing nothing.  Now don't let this cop fuck with your minds.
Duquette.  Forget him...
And you believe her?
Okay.  I love you too.
I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.  I thought I might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?
There's nothing for them to get.
Just like that?
Will they?
I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
That's right.  That was his name.
Yes.
Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
Yeah, or get me drowned.
But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
Fuck the winch.  I wanna drive.
Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
"Gadget guy?"  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
Quite.  Come, let's mingle.
Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
That's right... That's good.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
What is this?  A whole new train?
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
Would that include me?
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
Easy?  Easy?  On just what grounds should I take it easy!?
It's a smelting retort.
They're coming.
In an hour they're gone!
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
Yes...?
What is Tir Asleen?
My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these...
Too bad you're not more like your father.
As above, so below.
Good.  How long will it take?
Miserable Pecks.
What is it?
Friend of yours?
Nursemaid?!
Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time.  You were in her ten all night.  Did she say anything?
I'm used to her.  How's she doing?
That's all I ever wanted!
What do I need for that?
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
Me!
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
Ouch!  Let go of me!
Madmartigan.
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
How are we going to get out there?
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
Oh sure, Fred.
Try the house.
Tell you what – I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
You don't say.
...I want to say a thing.
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it.  I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
Just us.
Don't try me, Johnny!
They kid a lot.
You couldn't wait until morning?
I was wrong.
What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?
But you can't.
You tell him. When you're able.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.
Something wrong with buttons?
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
No. I'd want a public phone.
I'm going this morning.
A real fireball.
I was being foolish?
Aren't you? After today?
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
What the hell are you talking about? What's happening.
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Make that 1790.
I admit I don't know where he is.
Oh.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
His name is John Book.
Looks dead...
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
You have no right here!
Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
They are English. They don't understand.
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
To see?
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Who are you?
No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
Oh --
Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
No, they won't - honestly.
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Did you say something?
No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
Where's Kansas?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
B-B-B-B-B-But if we do that, we'll have to kill her to get it!
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
Oh --
Yeah --
Go on!
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
I was hoping you could tell me.
Just wanted to put him on edge...
So isn’t it time you unwrapped your present?
James.  It wouldn’t really be...
I could come for a second opinion?
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Indeed.
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs.
He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
Partially, yes.
Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask?
That’s every man within a five mile radius.  Including you.  That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You think I can’t do it. You think I’m going to screw up. Or get myself killed.
I think you’re one of the bravest people I’ve ever met.
I have to go.
You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
It is my oil!  Mine and my family’s!
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Have some of the rat’s nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline.
To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet.
Could...could you come?
Please.
Marvellous.
It’s heading for the oil terminal.
Don't call me that.
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
I could stay and go.
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .  You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
Jon -- what??
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
What is it?  How does it work?
Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!  I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel -- I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own life, and --
His . . . whatever.
Laurie --
I think he's going to the john.
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't matter.
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
Who says you're the good guys?
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop.
That's exactly why we need them.
Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that.
Naturally.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Hey, take it easy. I'm just a dude trying to make a buck.
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander?
Aren't you afraid?
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
Go to the water, it's that way!
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
You're joking, right?
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
It's like you said, every man for himself.
When else are you gonna do it?
Ferrari's, Lamborghini's... high end pasta rockets. Ten to start.
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
Including rape, pillage, murder.
Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
We all do.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
He's busy right now.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
You're backstage at the encore of creation.
He helped you?
And I'll never understand terrorists.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
And what do you do when you wake up to that?
Victor Frankenstein.
Ugly, vicious rumous.
Yes, sir.
MMmmm.
MMmmm.
And your passport?
Yes, don't worry.
I promise.
Oh, nice.
Whatever makes you happy.
You bet your boots it does.
Darling!
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
No, of course not.  I just meant...
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
I don't think so.  Is my assistant taken care of?
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
Yes, sir.
Are you putting me on?
I'm sure we will.
I wonder what's got into them?
Did you hear that strange music?
Must be the music room.
Could be raining!
That's not bad.
Thank you, Master.
You've got it, master.
Throw the third switch!
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
I'm not trying to be funny.
That's what we're paid for.
That sound good, boss.
Is everything ready?
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Yes!
I know.
It's some-thing dar-ing, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal,' A way of danc-ing that's real-ly ul-tra new; It's ver-y sub-tle, 'The Con-ti-nen-tal.'
Nor to Elizabeth.
...But an intellectual relationship, like this -- we could have as often as we wanted.  Three times a day -- anything!
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
Yes.
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
If I've got it right, My Lord, you lead an invasion into Zululand, for I see it all around me, but "why?" is the question my readers will ask. "why?"
I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
So far only their scouts. But we have had reports of a small Impi farther north, over there.
